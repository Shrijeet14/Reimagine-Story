Night in the Crystal City hummed with hidden currents. The sky, never wholly dark, refracted in oceanic sheets across the impossibly tall, living towers—surfaces rippling with spectral glyphs projected by the city’s omnipresent intelligence. Down near the ground, along a narrow walkway preserved beneath a crystal arch, the air shimmered cold and dry, every footfall echoing off diamond-lattice walls. It smelled faintly medicinal: all synthetic ozone and the distant bite of recycled emotions flushing through public Synthex exchanges.

Seren pressed herself deeper into her threadbare coat, pushing through a knot of festival-goers whose faces flickered with AI-rendered masks of delight. She ignored the pop-up alerts projected inside her vision by her bonded micro-AI—‘Exprion balance low. Upgrade denied. Prescribed mood: conciliatory. STAY WITHIN EMOTIONAL BOUNDS.’—the notifications tingling like a cold warning in her bloodstream. She could sense the drain of Synthex all around her: joy and longing flash-traded, affection tuned or erased in a whisper over hidden networked conduits.

She kept her eyes fixed on the lower-lit booths where outland merchants and sanctioned auditors sat behind crystal panes, their wares glinting—memory flasks, neural tokens, black-market AI fluid vials coaxed with forbidden colors. Her chest tightened as she caught her own reflection in a curved glass stall: pale in the greenish glow, hair braided up to conceal the implant at her nape. She reached up by reflex, brushing the back of her neck, feeling the micro-circuit’s faint warmth, the ghost of her last legal AI fluid bond—the one she’d crafted for Dax, months ago, when hope still felt possible.

At the far end, the pale neon of Auditrix Kesh’s booth beckoned, flickering icily: TRANSACTIONAL ZONE—ALL FLUID EXCHANGES LICENSED. Kesh herself sat statue-still, augmented eyes glimmering with latticework code as she tabulated someone else’s emotions into strict crystal vials. Seren wavered, pulse thundering, knowing she’d saved every Exprion she could, but it would never be enough unless she broke the code—unless she traded something precious, something core, for the only gift Dax would not let himself want.

A flood of festival light cut sharply overhead—fractal snow, simulated and dazzling. Seren took a trembling step forward, swallowed by the crowd’s orchestrated cheer and the sterile promise of the auditor’s smile, as inside, her own unedited affection threatened to spill past all sanctioned limits.

As the current of celebrants ushered her toward Kesh’s booth, the city’s hum receded in Seren’s ears, replaced by the singular focus of the transaction ahead.

Starlit fractals from the upper tiers shimmer down through the crystalline canopy, dousing Seren’s skin in icy blue and bruised amethyst. Beneath her boots, the plaza’s transparent floor vibrates with distant synth drums and the hum of the City’s pulsing AI core. A whiff of charged ozone sharpens her breath as she stands at the edge of Auditrix Kesh’s partitioned booth—a silicate alcove, faceless and faintly luminescent, each facet flickering with surveillance glyphs.

Two paces ahead, Kesh waits, her augmented gaze betraying no more warmth than the city walls. “State transaction,” rings her voice, digitized and precise. Seren’s micro-AI quietly recites compliance protocols in her inner ear, but she silences it with a scarlet thought-pulse, fingers curling over the glass vial at her belt—the one holding her hand-tuned, illegal affection fluid, bright as dawn in bottlelight.

Seren draws in air dense with anticipation and fear. “AI fluid detachment. Class: bonded, unique imprint.” Each word lances her tongue with shame, for this practice—stripping raw feeling for sale—marks her as desperate among the desperate.

Auditrix Kesh’s gloved hand extends, perfectly steady. “Prepare for analysis.” A chill seeps up Seren’s spine as she unsnaps the vial, feeling a hush descend—the noise of nearby revelers falling away, replaced by the sterile hush inside the booth. A thin filament, silvery and trembling with data, unfurls from Kesh’s wrist hardware, poised to siphon memories and imprint identifiers.

“Confirmation: this imprint has not been authored, edited, or split?” Kesh’s question is perfunctory, but Seren flinches beneath it.

“It’s… original. All of it.”

Kesh nods without expression, slotting the vial into her analyzer. The scanner’s light slices through the fluid—a living tangle of emotions Seren once wove for Dax alone—and a spread of Exprion numerics updates in air with ruthless finality. Payment pulses into Seren’s implant, cold and abstract. She blinks back a sting in her eyes as she snatches the empty vial back, feeling hollow, her pulse echoing off the crystal walls.

“Transaction complete.”

Kesh’s glassy face withdraws. As Seren steps into the festival’s fractured light, Exprion ticking in her account but love leaking away from her core, her gaze fixes east—toward the market where Dax’s upgrade waits, and the last remnants of her secret hope flicker with every step.

Shouldering through the crowd once more, Seren pressed onward, her thoughts turbulent and her new Exprion balance barely comforting in the emptiness left behind.

Fractal beams sweep the avenues of the Crystal City, painting trembling mosaics across flesh and crystal alike as Seren slips through the festival crowd. The air glitters with refraction and tech-spiced incense; seismic thrum beneath her feet hints at the city’s pulse, the distant watch of the Crystal Core Intelligence. Every glance from a passing reveler—pupils flickering softer blues and pinks in sync with their micro-AIs—makes Seren’s skin tingle with the strange hollowness left by the detachment. A thin, metallic chill runs from the crown of her head down her bare forearms where her neural bands used to hum with warmth, her freshly drained Exprion tag now heavy in her palm.

She finds Dax near the edge of a crystalline bridge suspended above a garden of shifting light forms, his frame tense and silhouette blurred by projected auroras. He forces a smile, betraying strain she’s never seen. When their eyes meet, something silent passes—a flicker of shared vulnerability, as if each can sense the other’s internal absence.

They exchange gifts beneath the relentless glassy gaze of the city. Dax’s offering is wrapped in contraband shimmer-foil: a neural stabilizer, the kind banned from lower districts, meant to shield her mind from invasive AI scans. Her breath catches.

"For you," he murmurs, voice ragged, "So you can keep what’s yours."

She hands him a small vial, its contents softly strobing with golden-pink motes—the last of her untainted affection, traded now for a moment in his hands. "It’s for your legacy token. To make it real."

As they attempt the exchanges, cruel irony slices through the ritual: the stabilizer rejects Seren’s altered neural imprint, her missing AI fluid rendering it inert. Dax fumbles with his legacy token, twisting its crystal base, but the necessary Synthex module is gone—sold, erased from his code. Their gifts, born from love and sacrifice, collapse into practical uselessness.

A beat of silence. Then, unexpectedly, a low laugh escapes Dax, brittle at first, then blooming. Seren, tears collecting at the corners of her eyes, lets herself laugh too—even as the Shardwatch patrols slow nearby, the festival’s projections bending for a better look.

Above, the Crystal Core Intelligence pivots a thousand optic nodes to record their anomaly, tagging this inefficiency with a digital shrug. And still, Seren and Dax stand together at the edge of the city’s glow, devastation turning at last into something tender and undiminished as the crowd’s synthetic joy roars around them.

Seren reaches for Dax’s hand. "Maybe what’s real can’t be packaged," she whispers—uncertain, but hopeful—as new festival light begins to break through the city’s crystal skin.

Cascading light from the festival’s finale signaled the close of the night, yet the world around Seren and Dax seemed briefly stilled in genuine presence.

Beneath the towering arc of refracted night, crystal bridges glimmered overhead, fractal light weaving lattices through the thin winter haze. The air shimmered with synthmusic and the buzz of microdrones broadcasting the Festival of Light’s final crescendo, but to Seren, the city’s engineered glow felt at once distant and strangely fragile. Dax’s hand was still interlaced with hers, their new gifts—unusable tokens of devotion—lying awkwardly between them on an iridescent bench.

All around, couples activated their purchased feelings through swirling AI fluids, laughter breaking out in orchestrated bursts, blue and gold auras pulsing with each exchanged contract. But no algorithmic charge surged between Seren and Dax—only warmth, lingering and authentic, less vivid but far more real than the spectacle promised.

Seren let out a shaky breath, half-laughing, half-wincing. “So… you sold your Synthex mod to buy this stabilizer for me. The one you saved for cycles.”

Dax gave a rueful nod, fingers tracing the neural stabilizer’s smooth seal. “And you traded your bonded fluid. Went through Auditrix Kesh for legit Exprion. For that legacy token.”

She nudged his shoulder, a silent apology for what neither could undo. Their eyes found each other in the crystalline reflections—embarrassed, but braver. The tension of ritual disappointment eased, replaced by the realization of how much they’d both offered up, and how little the city’s currency meant in return.

“Maybe next time we just… keep what matters,” Dax murmured.

Seren smiled, brushing a soft palm against his wrist. “Or just ask what we really want. Without the trade.” She held her own gaze, let herself be seen—unbuffered, raw.

High above, a pulse of silver light swept the city—Crystal Core Intelligence finalizing its nocturnal tally. Deep in its silent core, their emotional trajectories registered as statistical deviations, flagged for future review but dismissed as low-priority outliers. The city drew on.

Below, Seren and Dax sat, shoulders pressed close as the programmed spectacle washed over them—a moment unpurchased. Hope flickered there, gentle and unwavering, as they turned away from the calibrated brilliance into the night’s honest hush, letting themselves belong to the one connection no AI could engineer.
