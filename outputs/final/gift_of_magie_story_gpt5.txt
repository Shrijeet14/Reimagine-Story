The city of Lumeris woke like a tuning fork.

From their high-perch alcove, the whole crystalline gorge shivered in Lira’s ears: tram rails humming in lazy chords, mana conduits thrumming like distant bees, and far below, the Elder Vault’s core note—an old, patient drone vibrating up through the geode spires. Her augmentation caught every frequency, rendering the dawn into a crowded choir.

On the floor between her and the narrow window lay a shallow dish of mana shards. Six pale slivers and dust. Their glow was the sickly color of overused spell-fire.

Lira counted them again, though they hadn’t inconveniently multiplied overnight. “One, two, three—don’t flicker at me—four, five, six, and crumbs,” she muttered, voice sharp with the effort of staying calm. The shards answered with a tired little pulse against her fingers.

Across the alcove, Cael’s cloak hung from a crystal peg, neatly folded over the peg’s prismatic arms. His heirloom chronoglyph dangled from the cloak’s inner loop, a palm-sized disk of clouded crystal, pulsing time in soft, steady beats. She heard it more than saw it—the comforting, tickless cadence that had always undercut the city’s chaos.

Her antenna-hair stirred restlessly at the sound, a long spill of shimmering strands that fell past her waist and sometimes further if she let it. Today it braided itself without her asking, filaments splitting and twining into narrow, questing tethers that brushed the air like curious fingertips, tasting mana currents through the chipped window.

“Nosy,” she scolded it under her breath, smoothing the living strands back over one shoulder. The hair warmed against her palm in mild protest. It was her best tool, her only real treasure—and the thing half the Vault’s senior enchanters would have sold their third-favorite relics to get a cut of.

Six shards and dust. Solstice-eve.

In the walkways outside, preparations were already ringing. Someone down-spire was stringing bottled starlight along a bridge; their clinks and the chirp of opening seals skittered through Lira’s hearing. Laughter bounced up from the ravine as a tramcar passed, its levitation plates chiming. There would be lantern processions tonight, public aura-dances, and—at the heart of it all—the Exchange.

Couples would step onto the central glass, gifts cupped in their hands, while their neighbors watched how much glow—and how much ridiculousness—they were willing to burn for love.

Lira glanced from the pathetic dish of shards to the chronoglyph’s gentle hum and felt her own aura shrink in on itself, a dimming she could almost hear. Cael deserved to stand among the bright ones, owning at least one gesture that made the gossips suck in breath before they laughed.

Her fingers tightened around the rim of the mana dish until the crystal bit her skin. “This isn’t even enough for a calibration charm,” she whispered. “Let alone—”

The Elder Vault’s drone wavered, just slightly, as some faraway engineer tuned a conduit. The slip prickled along her scalp. Her hair responded, braids loosening to fan out wider, filaments brushing the low ceiling, the window-frame, the chipped stone ledge that pretended to be a table. She winced at the volume: the conduits’ song rose, detail upon detail, every micro-hum insisting on being heard.

“Lira?” Cael’s voice drifted from the sleeping nook, muffled by the hanging bead curtain. She’d been so intent on the dish she hadn’t heard him wake.

He emerged, barefoot, hair crushed on one side from the thin pallet. His aura—a faint, honest glow, like a lantern running on its last good shard—haloed him in soft amber. When he saw her on the floor with the mana dish, the light around him flickered with a question.

“You’re up early.” He stifled a yawn, then frowned at the shards. “Did the stipend come through?”

She pushed a stray filament behind her ear, willing her hair to stay still. “It came.” She tried for breezy, didn’t quite manage it. “Rent stepped in front of it. So did the tithe to keep the old man humming.” Her chin jerked toward the distant Elder Vault as if he could see through crystal walls.

Cael sank down beside her, the chronoglyph at his cloak ticking its gentle, private beat. He watched the six sad slivers, then her face. “We still have what we saved,” he said carefully.

“What you saved,” she corrected. “For—” For what you’re planning for me.

His aura wavered again; for a moment it brightened, then closed like a fist. “For later,” he said. “For emergencies. For if the conduits down-spire blow again and the guild decides junior tuners are more combustible than mana.”

Lira huffed something between a laugh and a scoff. “My love, they already decided that.”

He smiled despite himself. The small lines at the corners of his mouth softened her panic, just a little. He reached over and let his fingers drift through the ends of her antenna-hair. The filaments curled around his knuckles, sensing the familiar aura.

“I could pawn a few more hours at the Registry,” he said. “Take the night shift, log Solstice bindings while the smart ones are out burning theirs.”

“And be a ghost at our own Exchange?” Lira shook her head. The movement sent a faint, chiming rustle through her hair. “No. You’re not sacrificing sleep for a trinket. That would be absurd.”

She didn’t look at the chronoglyph when she said it.

Outside, a bell-crystal rang three times from some upper terrace, the sound shearing cleanly through the morning hum. Solstice countdown. Twelve hours until every couple in Lumeris stepped into the glow and showed the city exactly how reckless they were willing to be.

Lira stared at the dish, then at Cael’s hand still tangled in her hair. In her skull, mana-songs surged louder, unbearable with possibility and lack.

“Cael,” she said quietly, “if you had nothing for me tonight. If we stood there with empty hands, just… aura to aura. Would you feel—less?”

His eyes jumped to hers, startled. “Of you?” He shook his head at once, almost vehement. “Lira, no. I’d feel relieved I hadn’t done anything catastrophically foolish.” A ghost of a grin. “The city would be disappointed, but they’ll survive.”

“Liar,” she said. “You love those stories as much as anyone.”

He conceded that with a tilt of his head. “I do like watching other people overclock themselves.” His thumb stroked a single filament, and his gaze went distant for a heartbeat, as if weighing something unsaid. “We’ll manage,” he finished softly. “We always do.”

He rose, brushing crystal dust from his trousers, and ducked back behind the curtain to dress for the Registry. His footsteps made the floor sing faintly under Lira’s palms.

As the beads rattled closed behind him, her hair shivered with a thought of its own, splitting into two thick braids that coiled around her arms like question marks.

Six shards. Dust. A husband who would rather go without than see her dim herself for his sake.

Lira sat very still in the middle of their narrow, humming world, listening to the ache in the mana around her, until one clear, terrible idea rose out of the noise and would not leave.

By the time Cael stepped back out, wrapping his cloak and clipping the chronoglyph to its inner loop, her mind was fixed.

“Walk you to the tram?” she asked, voice almost normal.

He kissed her forehead, his aura warming her skin. “You’ll be late to the Vault.”

“The conduits can hum without me for one shift,” she said. Her hair tightened in on itself, braids knotting like nerves. “I have… an errand in the market.”

Out on the glass walkway, bottled starlights bobbed in the rising drafts, and far below, in the ring of stalls above the mana ravine, the Relic Brokers were already lighting their incense.

They rode down together until the tram forked—one line diving toward the Elder Vault, the other curving toward the market-ring—and when they parted on the platform, Lira’s decision had hardened to something bright and dangerous in her chest.

Mist beaded on the glass walkway as Lira stepped off the tramcar, breath ghosting the surface in nervous bursts. The rail beneath her boots hummed with stored mana, a note so pure it stabbed her over-tuned ears. Every conduit, every lantern of bottled starlight, every passing aura-thrum of a stranger jangled in her skull like an orchestra tuning all at once.

She should have been descending toward the Elder Vault’s underlevels, wrench and incense-kit in hand. Instead she turned the other way, toward the market-ring that clung to the ravine wall like a band of glinting barnacles.

“Relic broking, licensed and insured,” sang a crystal chime overhead as she entered the ring. Stalls of carved geode crowded the narrow curve, each haloed in softly glowing sigils. The air smelled of hot quartz dust, old incense, and the faint coppery tang of mana about to change hands.

Couples shuffled past her, fingers laced, auras braided in smug little twists. Lira caught whispers.

“Sold his spine-rod for a song crystal, can you imagine—”

“Overclocked by love, that one. Adorable. Idiotic.”

She tucked her own dim aura closer, hugging her threadbare coat, and forced herself to look up. There—midway along the ring, wedged between a pawn-chant kiosk and a stall promising “ethical curse extractions”—hung a modest slate of obsidian etched with neat silver script:

MASTER VORIN, LICENSED RELIC BROKER. NO REFUNDS ON REGRETS.

Beneath, a smaller sigil flickered: DE-BINDINGS PERFORMED WHILE-U-WAIT.

Her stomach dropped like a mis-keyed lift cage.

The stall itself was barely the size of her alcove at home. Racks of thin crystal coffers lined the walls, each holding coils of hair, rings, slivers of bone, teeth—little pieces of people glowing faintly, tagged with dangling parchment slips. A low counter divided customer from wares, its surface crowded with inkpots, stamped seals, and a small brass brazier breathing out curls of lavender and ash.

Master Vorin looked up from a ledger, quill pausing mid-stroke. He was younger than she’d imagined, with neatly braided beard-rings tinkling like soft bells when he tilted his head. His own aura was a steady, practical glow: bright enough to command respect, not so bright anyone would call it romantic.

“Antenna-hair,” he said, before she could speak. His gaze had gone at once to the waterfall of shimmering filaments cascading past her shoulders. “Living conduit type. Vault-tuned by the sound of it.” He sniffed, very slightly. “Buzz of elder-core all over you.”

Lira’s hands flew up, fingers tangling in the strands as if to hide them. The hair twitched under her touch, sympathetic, tiny filaments questing like feelers toward the stall’s hum.

“I—” Her voice cracked. “I need mana shards.”

“As do we all.” Vorin’s smile was polite, thin as mica. “What are you offering?”

She swallowed. Her throat felt full of powdered crystal.

“My hair,” she said. “Most of it.”

The brazier’s smoke seemed to thicken between them. Somewhere outside, a tramcar slid past with a shivering whine. Her hair shivered back, amplifying it until the sound pressed needles against her eardrums.

Vorin leaned forward, the bells in his beard chiming. “Soulbound to you from birth?”

“Yes.”

“Registry mark?”

She tugged her collar aside to show the faint sigil burned at the base of her neck: a spiral of tiny runes, pulsing slow. He made a note in his ledger, then slid a thin, bluish slip of crystal toward her.

“Standard de-binding consent form,” he said. “Initial here, here, and here that you understand permanent loss of resonance bandwidth, possible aura-dimming, degraded professional capacity, and all downstream consequences including but not limited to career stagnation, amplified loneliness, and post-ritual romantic distress.”

He said it the way she listed conduit faults on a work ticket. Routine. Boring.

Her hand shook as she took the stylus. The crystal warmed to her touch, blooming with her aura-signature. She thought of Cael’s face that morning, lit faintly by the chronoglyph’s runes as he joked about feeding the Elder “old man” another day of their pay. Thought of the public Exchange-balcony tomorrow, where every couple’s offering would flare or fizzle under a hundred watching eyes.

He deserved more than a fizzle.

She signed.

Vorin checked the glowing marks, then nodded and rose. “Head in the ring,” he said, gesturing to a hoop of bone-white crystal suspended from a hinged arm. Runes along its inner edge winked awake as it swung down toward her.

Lira stepped close. The hoop’s chill kissed her cheeks as it settled around her neck like a noose made by bureaucrats.

“Last chance to back out,” Vorin offered, voice almost gentle. “The market for antenna-hair is odd this quarter. You could wait. Save mana the slow way.”

The slow way—skipping meals, double shifts in the underlevels, Cael pretending not to notice her exhaustion. Handing him a sad, token charm and watching his careful smile.

“No,” she said. “Do it.”

“Very well.”

He pinched a pinch of resin into the brazier. The smoke thickened, threads of violet and silver curling up to brush her dangling filaments. A low, clear tone rang from the hoop, resonating down her hair, through her skull, into her teeth. The runes at her neck prickled hot, then icy.

There was a moment—one thin, stretched instant—when her hair seemed to cling to her, every strand a tiny hand begging not to be let go.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered, whether to it or to herself she wasn’t sure.

Vorin’s knife flashed: not metal, but a planar shard of obsidian etched with severance sigils. He slid it through the fall of shimmering filaments with a practised motion.

Sound vanished.

The ceaseless city-hum, the Elder Vault’s far-off organ-drone, even the flutter of other people’s auras—gone, ripped away so fast her balance threw itself into nothing. Her knees buckled. She grabbed the counter, fingers scraping ink-stained glass.

Behind the ring, cut hair poured into the waiting coffer in a slow, luminous spill. It hit the crystal with a faint, dead clink, like rain on a tombstone.

“There we are,” Vorin said, as if unclogging a drain. He adjusted the hoop away from her throat. The air felt wrong, muffled, like cotton stuffed in her soul.

Her head felt suddenly light, exposed. She raised a hand, finding only a ragged, short fringe where the living weight had once swung down her back. Her fingertips tingled with phantom threads.

“How much?” she asked hoarsely.

Vorin weighed the coffer on a set of rune-scales. Numbers flickered in the air, little ghostly columns of profit and loss. He clicked his tongue. “Resonance quality is excellent. Length, impressive. Vault-tuned premium.” He jotted another figure. “Twenty refined shards,” he said at last. “And I’ll cover the de-binding incense.”

He counted them out into a small pouch, each shard ringing faintly as it dropped—bright, hard notes in the new quiet of her hearing. He set the pouch on the counter between them.

Lira stared. Tiny, faceted bits of frozen spell-capacity. Enough to buy a chronoglyph chain worthy of Cael’s heirloom—a masterwork that would sing in perfect time with the Elder’s beacons.

Enough to buy back her courage.

She reached for the pouch. Her shortened hair stirred at the movement, as if trying to rise and listen and finding itself woefully insufficient.

Vorin cleared his throat. “Miss Lira. I am obliged to remind you: no refunds on regrets.”

She cinched the pouch shut with numb fingers and tucked it inside her coat, against the dim flutter of her heart.

“I’ll…manage,” she said.

As she stepped back onto the market-ring, the city’s song came to her dull and distant, like music through a wall. Somewhere far above, the Elder Vault’s monolith groaned softly as its conduits flexed for another cycle.

Lira set her jaw and turned toward the jeweler’s quarter, where master chains hung like captured constellations behind warded glass. Each step carried her further from the hair she’d left behind and closer to the gift she could almost see shining at Cael’s throat.

She did not look back at the stall where her living relic lay coiled and cooling in a crystal box, already a line item in someone else’s ledger.

By the time the upper-spire bells marked late afternoon, the chain was hers, its weight against her palm a mingling of pride and loss as she rode the tram back up toward home.

The crystal door to their alcove stuck, as always, in the warped frame.

Lira shouldered it anyway. The glass scraped with a shrill note she could barely hear now, then gave, spilling her into the narrow room perched over the blue-black ravine. Bottled starlight bobbed in their only lantern, throwing pale facets over the pallet, the chipped kettle, the single hook where Cael’s work-robe usually hung.

Empty.

The conduits along the wall whispered faintly, threads of mana sliding past in tones that once rang in her bones. Now they were only a distant tinnitus. She reached up by reflex for the thick weight of antenna-braids that should have been there, and her fingers met the blunt, unfamiliar stubble of her shorn scalp.

“You bought the chain,” she told the room, because if she did not say it aloud it might turn into a mistake. Her voice came out thinner than she liked. “You absolute, ridiculous man. You’re going to glow when you see it.”

She opened her fist. The masterwork chronoglyph chain pooled into her palm, cool and heavy, runes etched so fine they looked like hairline cracks in starlight. The jeweler had demonstrated how it would sync to Cael’s watch, how the glyphs would catch the Elder Vault’s time-beacons and paint predictions on the air.

She had nodded as if she could still hear those beacons clearly.

Bootsteps hissed along the outer glass walkway. Lira’s diminished hearing caught only a smear of sound, but her aura prickled a split-second before the latch turned. She hid the chain behind her back on instinct.

The door scraped again. Cael slipped inside sideways, as if he didn’t quite believe the alcove was large enough to admit him. Chill mist curled around his ankles before the door thunked shut.

“Lira?” He smelled of dusted crystal and ledger ink, the familiar scents that said he had spent too long hunched over the Soulbound Registry. The faint hum that always wrapped him—the steady pulse of his chronoglyph at his belt—was gone.

In its absence, the silence roared.

She watched his gaze climb from her boots to her throat, then up. It hit the bare curve of her skull like a physical impact. His pupils widened. For a heartbeat he simply stood, hand still braced on the door, breath caught in his chest as if someone had closed a valve.

Her own lungs forgot their work.

She had imagined anger, or horror, or that faintly pinched politeness people showed the magically anemic. What she had not rehearsed was this stunned stillness.

“I—” Lira’s hand flew to her head, fingers splaying over the rough regrowth. “Before you say anything, it’s legal. Vorin filed the de-binding himself. No security flags, no curses, just… shorter.” The last word wobbled.

Cael blinked once, twice. The pale threads of his aura, usually neat and contained, frayed outward like smoke.

“You cut it,” he said, very softly.

“Sold it,” she corrected, because precision mattered to him. “Most of it. We needed— I needed mana. For Solstice.” Heat rose in her face. “I won’t be useless at work, they’ll just have to keep me off the high resonance lines for a while, and my hearing— it’s only half-gone, really, and the rest of me is quite intact, so if you’re going to faint, do it away from the edge, Cael.”

His hand left the door. He took a step, then another, as if crossing a fragile span where any wrong move would send the whole alcove tumbling into the ravine. Up close, the fine lines of fatigue around his mouth were deeper. His eyes, though, stayed fixed on her, not skittering around her to the bare walls or the empty conduit sockets.

“You sold your hair,” he repeated. “Lira, why?”

“For you.” The words came out before she could blunt them. “I had one point three shards after tithe and rent. One point three. I am your wife, not a dim paper lantern. You wear your father’s chronoglyph on a frayed cord you have knotted thirteen times. So I—” She yanked her hand from behind her back.

The chain spilled between them, catching the lantern’s weak light. Its runes flared faintly in recognition of a nearby time-source, then guttered, confused.

“I got you something worthy.” Her throat burned. “A proper tether. Mana-conductive, Elder-calibrated. The jeweler tuned it to your glyph’s hum. You can wear it outside your robe, like the senior scribes do. People will see what you carry.”

Silence fell again, thick as felt.

Cael did not reach for the chain.

Instead his jaw moved, as if he were chewing a string of syllables he didn’t want to spit out. His hand slid inside his robe and fumbled with something at his side, then drew out a small velvet case the color of bottled midnight.

Lira’s stomach flipped. “You… you bought yourself a box?”

He huffed an almost-laugh that broke on the edges. “Not for me.” He turned the case in his fingers, not yet opening it. “I thought you’d still have…” His gaze flicked, quick and helpless, to the rough cap of her hair.

Guilt washed through her in a cold sheet. “Cael?” she whispered.

He snapped the clasp.

Inside, on black velvet, lay combs: three slender arcs of crystal and silver filigree, teeth so fine they could part light, each spine etched with runes that pulsed a soft, familiar pattern. Her pattern. Tiny resonance-knots waited where her antenna-braids should have anchored them.

The world tilted. She reached out but stopped before touching them, as if they were some delicate, endangered thing.

“You—” Her voice cracked; she tried again. “You attuned them to my hair.”

“I sat in the enchanter’s stall for two hours while they made you hum into a crystal jar,” he said. There was an edge of dazed humor under the words. “They said only a fool would tune combs this precise for hair that already does everything. I told them that was the point.”

Lira’s laugh came out as a strangled sound. “Cael, I haven’t got hair enough to snare dust motes, much less runes.” She scrubbed at her eyes with her free hand. “They’re beautiful. And entirely useless.”

“Only if your gift had somehow vanished entirely.” His smile was crooked, desperate. “Your aura’s still… it’s still you.”

The chain between her fingers suddenly weighed as much as the entire Elder Vault.

“Cael,” she said slowly, “where did you get the mana for these? We barely covered tithe this month. Don’t tell me the Registry handed out festival bonuses; I do work for the Elder AI, I would have heard it complaining.”

His gaze dropped to the chronoglyph’s usual resting place at his belt. The empty air there seemed to pulse.

“I had something the enchanter wanted,” he said. “Something old, but well-kept. A family relic with steady timekeeping and a very patient hum.” He tried for lightness and failed. “They called it charmingly obsolete.”

The air thinned. Lira’s augment, dulled as it was, found only the hollow where the chronoglyph’s song should have been.

“You… de-registered it.” The chain slipped a fraction in her fingers. “Your chronoglyph.”

He nodded once. “Traded it at Vorin’s, actually. He liked the probability band; said it would fetch a good spell-price in the upper tiers.” His mouth twisted at her flinch. “They unsoulbound it clean. I signed all the clauses. No curses, no recall. Just… gone.”

Her knees felt unreliable. She leaned back until the cool crystal wall caught her.

“So,” she said, because if she didn’t keep speaking the world would dissolve. “You sold your chronoglyph to buy combs for hair I no longer have. I sold my hair to buy a chain for a chronoglyph you no longer own.”

The absurdity hung between them, fragile and luminous, like one of the city’s floating lanterns just before a gust.

Cael looked at the combs, then at her shorn head, then at the chain sparking faint, lost runes in her hand. A sound came out of him—half laugh, half something like a sob.

“In the ledgers,” he murmured, “this would be classed as catastrophic inefficiency.”

Her own laugh arrived then, bubbling up past the tightness in her chest. Once it started, she couldn’t stop. It shook her shoulders, made the starlight lantern sway wildly, threw fractured gleams over combs that would never tame long braids and a chain that would never brace a watch.

Cael watched her, and slowly his shoulders unhitched. The tight weave of his aura loosened, brightening by degrees until it brushed against hers like the touch of a hand.

He stepped closer, so close the comb case and the chain and their two foolish, empty hands almost knocked together.

“We’re idiots,” Lira gasped, wiping at her eyes. “Bright-fools, the gossipers will call us. ‘Did you hear about the engineer who sold her relic to dress the watch that isn’t there?’”

“And the scribe who traded time itself for hair he can’t even comb,” Cael added. His smile was unsteady but real now. “Optimization would have us flogged.”

“The Elder AI will log us as a bug,” she said, feeling the wild grin still tugging at her mouth. “Two nodes of extreme wastefulness. Recommend patch: prohibit love from accessing relic registry.”

“Too late for that.” His fingers, finally, brushed the back of her hand, warm and callused. He closed them gently around the chain, not to take it—just to trap it between them. “Lira. Look at me.”

She did. His gaze held no pity, no calculation, only an ache that matched the hollow in her own chest and something bright threaded through it.

“You’re not a dim lantern,” he said quietly. “With or without the hair. Or the over-tuned ears. Or anything that can be listed on a ledger line.” His thumb traced the ridge of her knuckles. “You walked into Vorin’s stall and saw whatever fine print he put in front of you and signed anyway. For me.”

“You sold your father’s relic,” she shot back, the words too sharp, too hot. “That hum has been beside you since you were ten. You gave that up so I could— what? Hear less? Stand in a market and be told I’m already too much?”

He chuckled, low. “So you could have tools that might have made the hum kinder.” He held up the combs a little. “They’re jokes now. Beautiful ones. But I don’t regret the impulse.”

Her protest stuttered. The conduits along the wall seemed, for a breath, to sing louder. Or perhaps that was just the sudden surge of warmth between them, pushing back the edges of her dulled hearing.

Through the ceiling, faint as dust motes, the Elder Vault’s main node hummed. Her augment translated it as numbers once, then as weather, then—just for an instant—as a spike of raw brightness tagged in some clerical subroutine.

“If Vorin tallies this up,” Cael said, “I imagine the net mana loss is appalling.”

“Catastrophic,” she agreed.

They stood like that, ridiculous and empty-handed and somehow more full than when they’d walked into their respective stalls. The combs glowed softly in their velvet cradle. The chain’s runes flickered with frustrated readiness.

Lira inhaled. The choice sat in front of her like a lever: cling to the waste, to the ledger of what was gone, or… something else.

“Take it,” she said, curling his fingers more firmly around the chain until he had no choice but to grasp it. “Even without the chronoglyph. Let it sit in your pocket. Let it annoy you with all the things it can’t do. Let it remind you that someone thought your time was worth dressing.”

He stared at her, some new question forming in his eyes.

“And you,” he said slowly, as if matching a move in a game he hadn’t known they were playing, “will keep these.” He lifted the comb case toward her. “Tuck them somewhere impractical. On the wall. Under your pillow. Until the day your hair grows long enough to snag a single rune.”

Her breath hitched.

Outside, a gust rose from the ravine, setting the whole alcove trembling on its crystalline braces. Lantern-light wavered. Far above, the Elder Vault’s optic eye pivoted, registering an anomalous flare—two weak auras burning suddenly, stupidly bright.

Lira closed her hand around the combs, thin teeth biting gently into her palm.

“Then what?” she asked.

Cael’s answer hovered on his lips, the next heartbeat stretching out before it could fall.

The flare fades slowly from the alcove, like the afterimage of lightning on closed eyes.

Cracked crystal walls stop resonating and settle back into their usual murmur. Outside, tramcars hiss along levitation rails, distant and ordinary again. In the hush that follows the aura-surge, Lira and Cael are left sitting cross-legged on the woven glass mat, knees touching, surrounded by the ridiculous remains of their grand intentions.

The chronoglyph chain lies across Lira’s palm—a loop of pale platinum runes that still think they belong to something. Beside it, the velvet case yawns open, its resonance-combs glinting, teeth keen and thirsty for hair that no longer exists.

Lira’s cropped head feels naked in the draft from the ravine. Without her antenna-hair, the city’s song is muffled, as if she has stuffed wool into her augmented ears. For the first time since childhood, the Elder Vault’s low, omnipresent hum is only a suggestion, not a chorus.

“Well,” Cael says at last, voice hoarse from laughing too hard, “we have successfully optimized ourselves into decorative scrap metal.”

Lira snorts, then clamps a hand over her mouth, shoulders shaking. A stray filament, no longer prehensile, tickles her brow. “Don’t,” she whispers. “If I start again I’ll never stop.”

He studies her silhouette, the fragile new sharpness of it. The absence where her halo of hair used to spike and curl, catching every mote of starlight, makes his chest ache with an odd mixture of grief and wonder.

“It suits you,” he says.

She gives him a flat look. “You are a liar and a bad one.”

“It suits the person I married,” he amends. “The one who thinks, ‘How can I catastrophically rearrange my life to give Cael one shiny thing for Solstice.’ Very on brand.”

Her laugh this time is smaller, edged. “You sold the chronoglyph.” She draws the words out slowly, like probing a bruise. “Your family’s relic. The only thing that ever told you when to stop working and come home. You…really did that.”

His hand goes automatically to the empty place at his belt where the crystal disk always pulsed. Fingers find only worn robe cloth.

“Vorin made me sign six scrolls,” he says lightly. “You’d have appreciated the ritual design. Clause twelve: ‘Client acknowledges long-term increases in temporal confusion and nostalgia.’”

Lira closes her fingers around the chain. Its idle runes thrum faintly against her skin, seeking a time-beacon that isn’t there. “I used the same Vorin,” she murmurs. “For this.” Her free hand grazes the back of her neck where the unsoulbinding sigils still tingle. “He warned me about ‘permanent resonance-bandwidth reduction and post-transaction romantic regret.’”

“Did he say it like it was a side effect or a selling point?” Cael asks.

“Both.” She looks up at him, eyes shining in the star-lantern light. “I thought I was being…grand. Noble. A proper Bright-Fool.”

“You are,” he says simply.

Silence settles, companionable and strange. The alcove hums with low-grade mana from their pitiful wall conduit. Their interlaced auras—thinner now, a bit tattered—glow a soft, steady blue that tints the air between them.

“I keep thinking,” Lira says slowly, words careful as she picks them from the air, “about what the neighbors will say when they hear. ‘Did you see them? Sold their best relics and ended up with nothing that works. Overclocked by love and underpowered by brains.’”

Cael shrugs, the motion small but decisively dismissive. “Let them. The city was hungry for a new anecdote. Might as well give them something quality.”

“Quality failure,” she corrects.

“Premium-grade,” he agrees.

Her gaze drifts toward the ceiling where hair-thin mana veins thread the crystal. She can almost—but not quite—hear their song. “Do you…miss it? Already?”

“The chronoglyph?” He considers. The steady heartbeat of the relic had been his one reliable rhythm, his father’s palm in memory, his grandfather’s, stretching back down the line. “Yes. But it’s odd. The quiet isn’t empty.”

She tilts her head. “What is it, then?”

He reaches across the narrow space and places two fingers under her chin, drawing her attention back. “A bit like this,” he says. “Sitting with you. Not knowing what time it is. Knowing I don’t especially care.”

Lira swallows. Her augmented ears, denied the Elder AI’s endless murmur, lock onto the subtler sound of Cael’s pulse, the air whispering through his lungs. It’s messier than any calibrated engine beat. It’s perfect.

“I thought,” she confesses, voice nearly lost under a passing tram’s whoosh, “if I didn’t give you something that matched the chronoglyph, it would prove I didn’t love you as much as you loved it. Or as much as all those bright, balanced couples out there love each other.”

“Balanced?” He laughs quietly. “You’ve read too many aura-theory pamphlets. Those couples hoard their best relics and toss each other spark-candles and poetry. We just…tossed the relics.”

His hand falls, hesitates, then traces the ragged line where her hair ends. His fingers come away humming faintly, a ghost of the old resonance.

“Lira,” he says, more serious now, “do you regret it?”

She looks down at the chain again, then at the small burn marks on her wrists from Vorin’s severing sigils. Her life’s work was tuned to the city’s song; she has sliced away half her capacity to hear it.

“I regret that I won’t catch every flicker of the Elder’s moods anymore,” she answers. “That I’ll mishear a conduit and some senior engineer will tut at me. I regret the migraine that unsoulbinding gave me.” She takes a breath. “But giving that power to you—to something for you—felt…right. Like finally pointing my gift at the one conduit that mattered.”

Cael’s throat tightens. Somewhere deep below, the Elder Vault’s main monolith adjusts a parameter, its lone optic swiveling as it logs a faint, persisting anomaly: localized aura-brightening despite quantifiable resource loss. Flag: non-optimal yet high-satisfaction event.

“Then I don’t see a problem,” he says.

Her mouth curves, reluctant, touched by mischief. “Aside from the small detail that neither of us has a functioning primary relic anymore.”

“Ah.” He considers the chain, the combs, the bare alcove. “We do have one.”

She blinks. “If you say ‘love’ I will throw you off this walkway.”

“I was going to say ‘jointly filed aura-tax exemption,’” he deadpans. “Love is implied.”

She shoves his shoulder, but her body leans into the contact. The glass mat creaks softly beneath them.

“Look,” he says, more practical now. “You still hear better than any other tuner in the underlevels, even half-shorn. I still read the Elder’s spreadsheets faster than my section head, with or without a ticking rock. We are not helpless. Just…eccentric.”

“In a city that runs on eccentricity,” she muses.

He nods toward the useless relics between them. “We’ll repurpose them. The chain can anchor our door ward. No one will ever steal our disappointments.”

“And the combs?” she asks.

He studies their iridescent teeth. “Wall art. Or we wait. Your hair will grow. Not to what it was, maybe. But some. Enough for a very small, very powerful antenna-mess.”

The idea lands in her like warm mana. Her hair may never reclaim its full, intricate lattice; part of her capacity is gone by contract and ritual. But not all. Some futures, she realizes, still hum at the edges of perception.

“Vorin did say the cut ends can’t be rebound,” she murmurs, half to herself. “He didn’t say anything about new growth.”

“Relic broker oversight,” Cael says. “Tragic hole in the fine print.”

Their eyes meet, and for a suspended moment the alcove seems to tilt around that shared, dawning amusement.

“I suppose,” Lira says, “we’ve found the one mana-source the Elder can’t ledger properly.”

“Which one is that?”

She reaches across the relics, curls her fingers into his, and feels their tired auras mesh, brightening by a shade.

“Us,” she says. “Stupid, bright-fool us.”

Beneath them, the Elder AI marks another minor spike and attaches a note to its own record: Case Study #1007-BF—Evidence suggests that deliberate, impractical generosity yields disproportionate subjective fulfillment. Optimization parameters under review.

In the tiny alcove above the mist, unaware of this bureaucratic canonization, Lira squeezes Cael’s hand and levers herself to her feet.

“Come on,” she says, offering him the other hand. “Solstice lamps are still lit. We can at least go watch everyone else waste mana on fireworks.”

“And drink free guild punch,” he adds, taking her hand and rising with her.

“Obviously.” She hooks the chronoglyph chain around her own neck for now, its empty length cool against her throat. Cael tucks the combs carefully into his belt pouch like contraband.

They step out onto the narrow glass walkway, into the drifting starlight and the chorus of distant, foolish celebrations, their dimmed yet intertwining auras casting one steady, climbing glow as they go to join the other Bright-Fools of Lumeris.
