Moonlight bled through the latticed crystal of Lumeris, fretting along the cobblestones as Seris hurried beneath the kaleidoscopic spires. Her boots, patched and mana-scuffed, struck the pulse-lines etched into the city’s thoroughfares—a dull, echoing reminder of every mana shard she lacked. Around her, people glimmered with opalescent auras and wove spells with lazy, practiced grace; their laughter made the air feel too sharp, too brilliant. Seris tugged her long Veil of Auralight tighter around her shoulders, the cascading threads of enchanted, bioluminescent hair muffling the stray vibrations that sang at her auditory augmentations.

In her palm, the coin-pouch sagged—so little weight for so much hope. She counted again: a meager clutch barely enough for stale bread or a single flicker-crystal for the lantern at home. But the Festival of Silver Moons loomed, and Loras deserved a gift worthy of his boundless devotion—something to honor his Celestial Chron, the ancient timepiece he cherished and which anchored his magic. A prickle of shame wormed beneath her ribs. How could she face him empty-handed, her aura faded by want and worry?

Her path led her away from the main road into the shadow of the Quartz Allée; here, mana-lamps cast halos onto dream-dusted windows, illuminating relic merchants hawking starlit combs, glimmer-coins, wands with lullabies trapped within. Seris hesitated by the splayed door of a pawn cell—its bell chimed with a sympathetic shimmer, resonating through her bones. Inside, rows of soul relics lay behind hex-glass: unanchored, yearning, just as desperate as she felt.

A young Glass Guild courier paced past, his mantle brushed with motes of aura like drifting fireflies. Seris thought of Loras, always gentle, eyes limned with the faint glow of stored mana, voice low and resolute even when his shift dragged long into the moonlit night.

The longing pulsed sharp and sweet. Seris pressed trembling fingers to the ends of her Veil, feeling the living force coil there—the very heart of her arcane gift. She swallowed, gaze drawn to a distant, impassive figure behind a pane of glyph-marked etherglass: Archivist Ysil, the Guild’s most impassive broker, whose protocols promised payment—if she could dare the cost.

Summoning her resolve, Seris crossed the threshold into the pawn cell, her hair trailing like a comet’s tail, the weight of her decision humming through every fragment of her soul relic. Tonight, Loras would know how fiercely she loved him—even if it meant her own magic grew forever dim.

Frosted breath curled from Seris’ lips as she entered the guild chamber—a prism-walled sanctum patrolled by silent mana-puppets, their faceted skin scattering moonbeams in fractured shards across the rune-traced marble. Her heart hammered, echoing the cavernous hush, amplifying the faint song of her Veil of Auralight—a living waterfall of opalescent strands that trailed behind her, humming with personal resonance. The shimmering light dimmed, responding to her dread.

Archivist Ysil stood motionless amid plinths of levitating soul relics: a thin silhouette in a drape of guild-grey, face veiled by a hexagonal visor, hands interlaced with silvery appraisal glyphs. “State your offering,” the Archivist intoned, voice modulated by a whisper of circuitry—a perfect instrument for empathy’s absence.

Seris’s throat tightened. She unclipped a small, iridescent coil from her Veil, the cut edges flickering as if in mourning. Light bled along her fingers. “A true fragment of the Auralight. Uncorrupted. Seven cycles’ attunement.”

Ysil’s glyphs jittered, scanning the strand. For a moment, Seris perceived their resonance dance against her soul: a cold, efficient hunger. “Confirmed. Value—twenty mana shards. Transfer irreversible. Aura dimming permanent. Consent?”

Each word dented her resolve, but Seris nodded, forcing her fingers to release their hold. The chamber’s unseen sigils hummed, siphoning the magic through the Archivist’s hands. Agony pinched her temples—a harmonic wrenching inside her chest—as the relic’s brilliance died and the mana-shards crystallized into a shallow copper dish. Her Veil dulled, the chamber’s iridescence reflected in it now faded.

She snatched up the shards, biting back tears. “Why do you help us break ourselves?” Her voice was raw, a hush lost in empty grandeur.

Ysil glanced up, visor blank but for a flicker of mirrored sorrow—no more than artifact-induced static. “We do not break. We balance. The city thrives on gifts given and taken. That is its law.”

With the cold weight of mana pressed to her heart, Seris left the guild chamber, every step towards the Festival Market heavy, her magic lessened, but the pulse of her love untouched. Somewhere, deep in the crystalline lanes, the harmonics of her sacrifice echoed—a thread tugging her inexorably forward.

Later that evening, beneath the festival’s silvered banners, Seris made her way through throngs of celebrants. The crystalline air of Lumeris shimmered with moon-forged song as she crossed the festival threshold, her step unsure beneath the reverberant glow of her fading aura.

Eventually, she made her way home. In the shadowed corridor of their spire-apartment, everything felt brittle—the delicate lattices in glasswork humming with leyline current, her senses sharpened by recent loss. The Veil of Auralight, once a cascade of living starlight down her back, now fell shorn and muted around her shoulders; stray filaments brushed her cheek, their glow half-gone, casting unfamiliar shadows on the iridescent tile.

The lock-glyph on the door pulsed in response to Seris's depleted song. She pressed a trembling palm to the rune and sang the ancient chord—a lower register than before—barely coaxing the mechanism open. She entered, clutching a velvet pouch: the starlight chain for Loras, silver and woven with threads of harmonized mana, costlier for the remnant of herself spent to buy it.

The air inside was taut with anticipation. Loras stood motionless beneath the refracted moonbeams filtering through prism windows. His aura flickered weak, pale at the edges, as if he'd stepped out of the Dawnwell unprotected. In his hands, a box sculpted from opaline crystal flashed with inner harmony. He looked at Seris—eyes wide, uncertain joy twisting into silent ache as he took in her diminished veil.

"Seris... your magic," he breathed, reaching out, his voice catching against the room’s hush. Beneath his words pulsed something else—a splintered silence, as if the city’s ambient music paused to bear witness.

Seris’s answer tumbled out, fragile but certain: "For you. So we—so you could carry your family’s time-magic into new cycles. Here." She pressed the pouch into his hand. The chain coiled and shimmered, reflecting the ghostly moonbows cast through glass, achingly bright against her dulled aura.

Loras’s fingers closed over the chain’s weight. He swallowed, then offered the opaline box to Seris, eyes shining. "You gave up your light for me. And I sold the Chron—my soul’s anchor—so you could have this comb. It would’ve made your veil sing brighter than ever."

The truth hung raw in the chill air, gifts cradled useless between them—each token dependent on the other's sacrifice. Time suspended in crystalline silence. Outside, festival bells tolled, distant and strange, as Seris’s breath shivered and her heart surged toward revelation.

Stillness lingered, laden with unspoken ache, as realization washed over them both.

Iridescent moonlight spilled through the crystal panes, splattering the bare chamber with fractured constellations. Seris stood in their small spire-apartment, her hands trembling as she traced Loras’s jaw, fingers hesitating over the edge where his aura, once vibrant indigo, now flickered a subdued violet-gray. The jeweled comb—the Opaline Comb of Harmonizing she had received—gleamed useless in her palm, its prismatic teeth whispering with resonance her veil of auralight could no longer answer. In his hands, the starlit chain—her gift to him—dangled limply, fine spirals of etched glass waiting for the Celestial Chron he had relinquished.

Loras swallowed hard, voice rough as weathered stone. “I… I thought if I lost the Chron, perhaps the moments I lost could be given to you instead.”

Seris shook her head, tears sparkling along the remnants of her auralight hair. Magic pulsed weak and uneven at her temples, the loss palpable as the ache in her chest. “And I gave my veil’s brilliance for you—so your Chron would carry the light of every star we ever wished for.” Her breath caught, the air thrumming with the hush of spent enchantment.

“Foolish,” he murmured, yet his lips shaped a tremulous smile, drawn to hers by gravity deeper than any leyline. “I’ve nothing but empty hands—no time to lend, nothing left but love.”

Seris slid the comb into her faded hair, feeling nothing but the comb’s chill against her scalp. When she looked at Loras, it was not with despair, but a dawning awe. Their auras, though diminished, mingled at their edges—a new, gentle spectrum where neither color dominated, impossibly soft but undeniably whole.

“We are more than what we give away,” Seris whispered, pressing her forehead to Loras’s. Her words stitched into the hush, binding their wounds. “The magic was never in relics or light.”

As the chamber filled with the wavering song of the distant city, their hearts answered in resonance—each sacrifice weaving an unseen web that shimmered faintly, defying the loss. The moonlight, sensing the shift, cast their shadows as one: entwined, inseparable, and quietly radiant.

Outside, the city’s spires glimmered with silent witness, and within, Seris cupped Loras’s face, hope fluttering in her fingers. “We begin again,” she vowed, voice hushed yet fierce, as the first dawn shimmered across the glass.
