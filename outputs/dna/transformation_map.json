    "technology_or_magic": "Magic is entwined with technology. Personal artifacts \u2014 \u2018soulbound relics\u2019 \u2014 are the source and limit of individual magical power; these range from inherited combs to ancient blade fragments. Citizens are born with Arcane Gifts, expressed through enchanted hair, heirlooms, or bioluminescent light crystals. Artificial Intelligences (AI) from the founders\u2019 era remain, ensconced in labyrinthine cores. All trade and labor are compensated in crystallized mana shards. Sacrificial acts of love literally alter one's magical resonance, enhancing or diminishing auras, sometimes permanently.",
    "culture": "Lumerians revere the balance of giving and taking; selflessness is considered the ultimate wisdom. Gift-giving, especially of parts of one\u2019s soul relic, is culturally cherished but dangerous. Corporations are governed by councils of Mage-Executives who consult ancient AI \u2018Elders\u2019\u2014sentient servers with relic interfaces. Maintenance engineers are a respected caste, permitted to commune with AI. Augmentations are rare, mostly auditory, and seen as a mark of near-sacrificial vocation. Social status correlates with aura vibrancy and the potency of soul relics.",

      "AI Elders cannot interact directly; they speak only through human intermediaries or mainframe avatars.",
      "Maintenance areas are warded, filled with perceptible energy patterns and resonant server hums. Engineers with auditory augmentations experience these as near-painful symphonies.",
      "Restoring a damaged relic is impossible; lost aura and magic are irretrievable."
