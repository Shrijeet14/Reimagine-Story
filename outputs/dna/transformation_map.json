Every citizen is bonded to a micro-AI that enables reality-bending abilities\u2014projecting illusions, shaping matter, or altering senses\u2014within strict digital constraints. All transactions (goods, services, even emotions) use a digital currency called \u2018Exprion\u2019. Emotional connections, including love, are enacted via \u2018AI fluids\u2019: programmable, nanite-rich liquids that foster artificial bonds and transmit curated feelings.",
    "culture": "Society is divided by access to Synthex upgrades and Exprion reserves. Relationships and families form around contractual exchanges, where expressions of care\u2014or even affection\u2014can be traded or bought. Traditional human sentiment is rare, replaced by a transactional view of connection, yet threads of longing for genuine feeling persist. The Crystal City\u2019s elite regulate the AI magic flows, controlling both economic and magical power. Festivals center on AI-run spectacles, while illicit groups seek ways to disrupt official Synthex channels to reclaim authentic emotion.",

      "Love or sacrifice enacted via AI fluids is traceable and reversible, calling the authenticity of such acts into question.",
