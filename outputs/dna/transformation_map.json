    "setting": "The Kingdom of Lumeris \u2014 City of Crystal Spires. A labyrinthine metropolis of translucent towers and suspended walkways, aglow with prismatic light. At its heart stands the Citadel of Nodes, home to the ancient corporate AI called The Grand Lumen.",
    "era": "Age of Arcana (pre-industrial magical era), where society balances hand-wrought craftsmanship with pervasive arcane technology.",
    "technology_or_magic": "Magic operates through soulbound relics: artifacts fused to an individual's essence, granting unique powers (e.g., enchanting hair, light-wielding heirlooms). Each relic is fueled by the owner's aura, measured in mana shards\u2014a currency distilled from spiritual vigor. Arcane Gifts manifest as personalized enchantments. The most powerful AI, The Grand Lumen, houses its mind within the 'old man': a towering, cryptic mainframe featuring the 'eye', an ancient visual probe. Citizens use augmentations, such as the protagonist's auditory implant, which amplifies their senses for specialized tasks.",
    "culture": "Society reveres the maintenance and evolution of magical technology. Personal sacrifice, especially one made for love, is visible: the act can literally fade or intensify one's magical aura, altering social status. Gift-giving is bitterly ironic\u2014some gifts sap the giver\u2019s own mana, enriching the recipient. Hierarchies are determined by one\u2019s relic resonance and mana shard reserves. Corporate guilds control access to core relic technologies and AI knowledge, and the AI's custodians are both respected and pitied for the burdens their roles entail.",
    "tone": "Mysterious: The city\u2019s brilliance is tinged with secrecy. Emotions have tangible consequences, and hidden motives are wrapped in crystalline beauty.",
    "world_rules": [
      "Soulbound relics cannot be safely transferred except through life-altering sacrifice.",
      "Love-driven sacrifice can directly increase or diminish magical power.",
      "Mana shards are finite; reckless spending or over-gifting leads to lasting aura loss.",
      "AI nodes (like the 'old man') are revered yet feared, and only approved engineers may approach them.",
      "Implanted augmentations enhance skills but make users vulnerable to sensory overload.",
      "Enchantment misuse or failed sacrifices can result in permanent magical scars\u2014visible and social."
