  "text": "Frosted breath curled from Seris\u2019 lips as she entered the guild chamber\u2014a prism-walled sanctum patrolled by silent mana-puppets, their faceted skin scattering moonbeams in fractured shards across the rune-traced marble. Her heart hammered, echoing the cavernous hush, amplifying the faint song of her Veil of Auralight\u2014a living waterfall of opalescent strands that trailed behind her, humming with personal resonance. The shimmering light dimmed, responding to her dread.\n\nArchivist Ysil stood motionless amid plinths of levitating soul relics: a thin silhouette in a drape of guild-grey, face veiled by a hexagonal visor, hands interlaced with silvery appraisal glyphs. \u201cState your offering,\u201d the Archivist intoned, voice modulated by a whisper of circuitry\u2014a perfect instrument for empathy\u2019s absence.\n\nSeris\u2019s throat tightened. She unclipped a small, iridescent coil from her Veil, the cut edges flickering as if in mourning. Light bled along her fingers. \u201cA true fragment of the Auralight. Uncorrupted. Seven cycles\u2019 attunement.\u201d\n\nYsil\u2019s glyphs jittered, scanning the strand. For a moment, Seris perceived their resonance dance against her soul: a cold, efficient hunger. \u201cConfirmed. Value\u2014twenty mana shards. Transfer irreversible. Aura dimming permanent. Consent?\u201d\n\nEach word dented her resolve, but Seris nodded, forcing her fingers to release their hold. The chamber\u2019s unseen sigils hummed, siphoning the magic through the Archivist\u2019s hands. Agony pinched her temples\u2014a harmonic wrenching inside her chest\u2014as the relic\u2019s brilliance died and the mana-shards crystallized into a shallow copper dish. Her Veil dulled, the chamber\u2019s iridescence reflected in it now faded.\n\nShe snatched up the shards, biting back tears. \u201cWhy do you help us break ourselves?\u201d Her voice was raw, a hush lost in empty grandeur.\n\nYsil glanced up, visor blank but for a flicker of mirrored sorrow\u2014no more than artifact-induced static. \u201cWe do not break. We balance. The city thrives on gifts given and taken. That is its law.\u201d\n\nShe pressed the cold weight of mana to her heart and turned away, every step towards the Festival Market heavy, her magic lessened, but the pulse of her love untouched. Somewhere, deep in the crystalline lanes, the harmonics of her sacrifice echoed\u2014a thread tugging her inexorably forward.",
  "summary": "Seris trades a living fragment of her magical Veil of Auralight to Archivist Ysil within the cold, emotionless halls of the Guild of Ethershard. The loss dims both her aura and her power, wringing pain from soul and body, but Seris accepts the mana shards\u2014fuel for her coming gift. Weighed down by sacrifice yet driven by love, she departs for the Festival Market, heading deeper into fate's entwined pattern.",
