  "text": "Seris slipped from their tower as dawn fractured the clouds, the prismatic glow bathing her pale features and Aurora Tresses in shifting streams of colored light. The city throbbed with the pulse of mana as artisans and augurs streamed beneath towering crystal arcades. Every brush of Seris\u2019s living hair against her back sent flares of warmth and longing through her aura\u2014reminding her just how much she was about to lose. \n\nDescending into the labyrinthine undercity, the shine dulled to a whispering gloom, crystalline walkways replaced by tangled pipes and flickering glyph lanterns. Seris gripped her worn satchel, tracing each mana shard within by touch, the heat from her auditory implant amplifying the shivering clangor of every footfall as if her own heartbeat betrayed her resolve.\n\nShe found Shard Broker Lys in a curtained alcove, his eyes gleaming near piles of tangled relic fragments. The air was cold and shot through with the metallic scent of distilled essence. Without flourish, Lys beckoned her to the battered examination orb. \u201cYou understand this cannot be undone,\u201d he stated, voice flat as glass. Seris hesitated\u2014a tremor of doubt flitted through her aura, visible as a faint dimming at her temples\u2014then nodded.  \u201cProceed.\u201d\n\nLys\u2019s extractor hummed as he drew the Aurora Tresses from her head, light snuffing out strand by strand. Seris\u2019s knees trembled; the world grew colorless at the edges, sound warping so the broker\u2019s chanting and the machine\u2019s buzz braided into a dull roar. Mana shards, alive with her own aura, clinked into Lys\u2019s palm. \n\nWhen it was finished, Seris stood lightheaded and cold, her shorn hair barely grazing her nape, her creative magic hollowed. But the sack in her hand\u2014now heavy with shards and possibility\u2014throbbed against her palm in time with her racing heart. Clutching it, she turned on shaking legs, the city\u2019s crystalline breath rising to meet her as she ascended, uncertain if Veyr would ever see her the same\u2014or see her at all\u2014once she delivered her devastating gift.",
  "summary": "Seris ventures into the shadowy undercity to sell her treasured Aurora Tresses. The extraction leaves her weakened and visibly changed, but she now carries enough mana shards to fulfill her sacrifice for Veyr. As she returns, the city feels both alien and expectant, foreshadowing the profound consequences of her choice.",
