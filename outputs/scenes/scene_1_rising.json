  "text": "Starlit fractals from the upper tiers shimmer down through the crystalline canopy, dousing Seren\u2019s skin in icy blue and bruised amethyst. Beneath her boots, the plaza\u2019s transparent floor vibrates with distant synth drums and the hum of the City\u2019s pulsing AI core. A whiff of charged ozone sharpens her breath as she stands at the edge of Auditrix Kesh\u2019s partitioned booth\u2014a silicate alcove, faceless and faintly luminescent, each facet flickering with surveillance glyphs.\n\nTwo paces ahead, Kesh waits, her augmented gaze betraying no more warmth than the city walls. \u201cState transaction,\u201d rings her voice, digitized and precise. Seren\u2019s micro-AI quietly recites compliance protocols in her inner ear, but she silences it with a scarlet thought-pulse, fingers curling over the glass vial at her belt\u2014the one holding her hand-tuned, illegal affection fluid, bright as dawn in bottlelight.\n\nSeren draws in air dense with anticipation and fear. \u201cAI fluid detachment. Class: bonded, unique imprint.\u201d Each word lances her tongue with shame, for this practice\u2014stripping raw feeling for sale\u2014marks her as desperate among the desperate.\n\nAuditrix Kesh\u2019s gloved hand extends, perfectly steady. \u201cPrepare for analysis.\u201d A chill seeps up Seren\u2019s spine as she unsnaps the vial, feeling a hush descend\u2014the noise of nearby revelers falling away, replaced by the sterile hush inside the booth. A thin filament, silvery and trembling with data, unfurls from Kesh\u2019s wrist hardware, poised to siphon memories and imprint identifiers.\n\n\u201cConfirmation: this imprint has not been authored, edited, or split?\u201d Kesh\u2019s question is perfunctory, but Seren flinches beneath it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 original. All of it.\u201d\n\nKesh nods without expression, slotting the vial into her analyzer. The scanner\u2019s light slices through the fluid\u2014a living tangle of emotions Seren once wove for Dax alone\u2014and a spread of Exprion numerics updates in air with ruthless finality. Payment pulses into Seren\u2019s implant, cold and abstract. She blinks back a sting in her eyes as she snatches the empty vial back, feeling hollow, her pulse echoing off the crystal walls.\n\n\u201cTransaction complete.\u201d\n\nKesh\u2019s glassy face withdraws. As Seren steps into the festival\u2019s fractured light, Exprion ticking in her account but love leaking away from her core, her gaze fixes east\u2014toward the market where Dax\u2019s upgrade waits, and the last remnants of her secret hope flicker with every step.",
  "summary": "Seren submits to Auditrix Kesh's cold, official process, selling her one-of-a-kind affection AI fluid for desperately needed Exprion credits. The detachment ceremony is clinical and dehumanizing, leaving Seren emotionally drained but determined. With new currency in hand, her thoughts shift anxiously toward what she hopes to buy\u2014and the growing distance inside herself.",
