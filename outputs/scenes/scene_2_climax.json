  "text": "The crystalline air of Lumeris shimmered with moon-forged song as Seris crossed the festival threshold, her step unsure beneath the reverberant glow of her fading aura. In the shadowed corridor of their spire-apartment, everything felt brittle\u2014the delicate lattices in glasswork humming with leyline current, her senses sharpened by recent loss. The Veil of Auralight, once a cascade of living starlight down her back, now fell shorn and muted around her shoulders; stray filaments brushed her cheek, their glow half-gone, casting unfamiliar shadows on the iridescent tile.\n\nThe lock-glyph on the door pulsed in response to Seris's depleted song. She pressed a trembling palm to the rune and sang the ancient chord\u2014a lower register than before\u2014barely coaxing the mechanism open. She entered, clutching a velvet pouch: the starlight chain for Loras, silver and woven with threads of harmonized mana, costlier for the remnant of herself spent to buy it.\n\nThe air inside was taut with anticipation. Loras stood motionless beneath the refracted moonbeams filtering through prism windows. His aura flickered weak, pale at the edges, as if he'd stepped out of the Dawnwell unprotected. In his hands, a box sculpted from opaline crystal flashed with inner harmony. He looked at Seris\u2014eyes wide, uncertain joy twisting into silent ache as he took in her diminished veil.\n\n\"Seris... your magic,\" he breathed, reaching out, his voice catching against the room\u2019s hush. Beneath his words pulsed something else\u2014a splintered silence, as if the city\u2019s ambient music paused to bear witness.\n\nSeris\u2019s answer tumbled out, fragile but certain: \"For you. So we\u2014so you could carry your family\u2019s time-magic into new cycles. Here.\" She pressed the pouch into his hand. The chain coiled and shimmered, reflecting the ghostly moonbows cast through glass, achingly bright against her dulled aura.\n\nLoras\u2019s fingers closed over the chain\u2019s weight. He swallowed, then offered the opaline box to Seris, eyes shining. \"You gave up your light for me. And I sold the Chron\u2014my soul\u2019s anchor\u2014so you could have this comb. It would\u2019ve made your veil sing brighter than ever.\"\n\nThe truth hung raw in the chill air, gifts cradled useless between them\u2014each token dependent on the other's sacrifice. Time suspended in crystalline silence. Outside, festival bells tolled, distant and strange, as Seris\u2019s breath shivered and her heart surged toward revelation.",
  "summary": "Seris and Loras reunite in their spire-apartment, both bearing the marks of their sacrifice\u2014her diminished magical veil, his weakened aura. Their exchange of gifts unravels the devastating irony: each has given up their soul relic to buy an enhancement for the other's, rendering both tokens symbolically precious but functionally futile. As moonlight refracts through their pain, they stand on the cusp of understanding the profound depth of their love.",
