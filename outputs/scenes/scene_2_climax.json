  "text": "Fractal beams sweep the avenues of the Crystal City, painting trembling mosaics across flesh and crystal alike as Seren slips through the festival crowd. The air glitters with refraction and tech-spiced incense; seismic thrum beneath her feet hints at the city\u2019s pulse, the distant watch of the Crystal Core Intelligence. Every glance from a passing reveler\u2014pupils flickering softer blues and pinks in sync with their micro-AIs\u2014makes Seren\u2019s skin tingle with the strange hollowness left by the detachment. A thin, metallic chill runs from the crown of her head down her bare forearms where her neural bands used to hum with warmth, her freshly drained Exprion tag now heavy in her palm.\n\nShe finds Dax near the edge of a crystalline bridge suspended above a garden of shifting light forms, his frame tense and silhouette blurred by projected auroras. He forces a smile, betraying strain she\u2019s never seen. When their eyes meet, something silent passes\u2014a flicker of shared vulnerability, as if each can sense the other\u2019s internal absence.\n\nThey exchange gifts beneath the relentless glassy gaze of the city. Dax\u2019s offering is wrapped in contraband shimmer-foil: a neural stabilizer, the kind banned from lower districts, meant to shield her mind from invasive AI scans. Her breath catches.\n\n\"For you,\" he murmurs, voice ragged, \"So you can keep what\u2019s yours.\"\n\nShe hands him a small vial, its contents softly strobing with golden-pink motes\u2014the last of her untainted affection, traded now for a moment in his hands. \"It\u2019s for your legacy token. To make it real.\"\n\nAs they attempt the exchanges, cruel irony slices through the ritual: the stabilizer rejects Seren\u2019s altered neural imprint, her missing AI fluid rendering it inert. Dax fumbles with his legacy token, twisting its crystal base, but the necessary Synthex module is gone\u2014sold, erased from his code. Their gifts, born from love and sacrifice, collapse into practical uselessness.\n\nA beat of silence. Then, unexpectedly, a low laugh escapes Dax, brittle at first, then blooming. Seren, tears collecting at the corners of her eyes, lets herself laugh too\u2014even as the Shardwatch patrols slow nearby, the festival\u2019s projections bending for a better look.\n\nAbove, the Crystal Core Intelligence pivots a thousand optic nodes to record their anomaly, tagging this inefficiency with a digital shrug. And still, Seren and Dax stand together at the edge of the city\u2019s glow, devastation turning at last into something tender and undiminished as the crowd\u2019s synthetic joy roars around them.\n\nSeren reaches for Dax\u2019s hand. \"Maybe what\u2019s real can\u2019t be packaged,\" she whispers\u2014uncertain, but hopeful\u2014as new festival light begins to break through the city\u2019s crystal skin.",
  "summary": "At the Festival of Light, Seren and Dax exchange their gifts\u2014each a costly, desperate sacrifice\u2014only to find them functionally useless due to what the other has sold. After a moment of raw disappointment, they discover humor and a deeper intimacy in their mutual folly, unnoticed by the city\u2019s emotionless AI. Their hands find each other, and hope flickers beneath the relentless, artificial brilliance.",
