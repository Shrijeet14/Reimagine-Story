  "text": "Seris stepped into the antechamber of their narrow loft, crystalline panes humming with chromatic dusk. Her footsteps whispered over cold prismstone tiles; each movement felt lighter, as though something vital had been siphoned from her bones. The air carried the scent of ember-oil and faded mana blooms. Veyr, framed in the shadow-cast doorway, paused as their gazes locked\u2014his eyes wide, one trembling hand working at the chain-link clasp of his threadbare tunic. His aura, once edged in patient gold, flickered pale and diminished.\n\nShe offered a trembling smile and extended her gloved palm. Nestled within, the mana chain shimmered\u2014fasciae of woven silver and distilled aurora light pulsing faintly. \u201cHappy Arcanum Eve,\u201d she whispered, voice half-broken, mana echo thinned by loss. \n\nHe blinked in disbelief. In his hands, he gently cradled a lacquered box; hungry anticipation edged the air, taut and shimmering with arcane tension. He opened it\u2014inside, the Crystal Combs refracted dusk, opaline tangles glinting with intricate runes designed to harmonize with relic hair. Hope briefly flared across his features before dissipating as he fully saw her: Seris\u2019s head, shorn of luminous tresses, her aura haloed in aching blue rather than radiant gold.\n\n\u201cSeris\u2026\u201d Pain cracked Veyr\u2019s voice as realization seized him\u2014he reached for her, desperation bleeding through his words. \u201cYour Tresses\u2026? But this gift\u2014\u201d\n\nHer hands shook as she accepted the box, fingers grazing carved crystal not meant for her barren scalp. \u201cAnd you\u2026 your watch? I can feel it. Your lightwatch\u2019s tether has been broken.\u201d \n\nHe bowed his head; absence of the lightwatch left his aura jagged, the room dimming in sympathy. The silence between them pressed close, as if the spires themselves mourned.\n\nOutside, the unseen \u201ceye\u201d of The Grand Lumen rotated in its spire. Across the city, lights refracted toward their window; by some arcane law, the mutual loss between Seris and Veyr combusted into a luminous cascade. Their auras, emptied and raw, surged with a shimmering burst\u2014a visible testament to love-paid sacrifice. The mana chain shivered, the combs refracted living light, yet both objects now hovered between impotence and transcendence.\n\nVeyr dared one step forward, arms opening with a plea traced in crystalline tears. \u201cWhatever remains,\u201d he murmured, voice catching in the hush, \u201clet it be ours.\u201d Seris exhaled, reaching toward him. All around, the city seemed to lean closer\u2014awaiting the choice they would make next.",
  "summary": "Seris and Veyr exchange their carefully sacrificed gifts, only to discover the painful irony: each has given up their soulbound relic, rendering the other's present void of its intended meaning. This mutual loss triggers a brilliant flare in their aura, seen throughout the city, transforming their sacrifice into a public testament of love. In the shimmering aftermath, Seris and Veyr stand at an emotional crossroads, their connection\u2014and the city's gaze\u2014hanging on what they choose next.",
