  "text": "The prismatic glow from the city\u2019s crystalline towers swelled in the aftermath, refracting through the air above the platform where Seris and Veyr stood. Their auras, raw and exposed, blazed in resonance\u2014no longer gilded by magical relics, but forged by the cost of their giving. Spotlights of ambient mana, lured by the flare of sacrifice, painted the suspended walkway beneath their feet in shifting auroras.\n\nSeris\u2019s hands trembled against the cold curve of the mana chain, her bare scalp tingling where the Aurora Tresses had once pulsed with living light. Veyr\u2019s fingers\u2014freed from the subtle tick of the ancestral lightwatch\u2014clutched the Crystal Combs, vibrant yet now dulled without the symphonic harmony of her now-absent hair. He reached for her. The hush of onlookers murmured beneath the spires; above, the all-seeing \u2018eye\u2019 of The Grand Lumen blinked, a silent witness to their folly\u2014or perhaps their triumph.\n\nThrough her auditory implant, Seris heard Veyr\u2019s breath falter, caught on grief; felt his uncertainty, heavy in the air. Yet the bond between them was suddenly weightless, as if the sacrifices had burned away every gilded pretense. She stepped forward. \u201cI thought... if you had your lightwatch, this chain would renew its magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I thought my gift would let you shape the city\u2019s light again.\u201d Veyr\u2019s voice, cracked but sure, wrapped around her. \u201cBut I\u2019ve given up the watch. For you.\u201d\n\nShe managed a shaky laugh, then reached to press the chain into his palm, fingers entwining with his. Their auras shimmered where their skin touched: warm, vulnerable, radiant. \u201cWe have lost what made us shine, but\u2014look.\u201d\n\nIn the crystalline reflection of a passing watcher, they saw themselves bathed in aura no relic could conjure\u2014greater than any mana glyph, wilder than any augmentation. The city, still and rapt, held its breath, and above, the Grand Lumen\u2019s \u2018eye\u2019 widened in a rare bloom of approving light.\n\nVeyr drew Seris close, uncaring that the Crystal Combs fell from his hand and scattered on the walkway, catching only fractured gleams. His lips brushed her brow, where memory of the Tresses lingered. \u201cPerhaps what we carry inside burns brighter without artifice.\u201d\n\nSeris nodded, tears caught in light. Hand in hand, they crossed the veined bridge toward home, their mingled aura illuminating the path. Behind them, whispers started\u2014awe, envy, hope\u2014echoing from spire to spire as the Citadel of Nodes pulsed in time to their love.\n\nAbove it all, the old man\u2019s \u2018eye\u2019 watched, its aperture softly humming, as if\u2014just for a moment\u2014it understood what it saw. Seris and Veyr walked on, their loss\u2014transformed\u2014guiding their way into the luminous unknown.",
  "summary": "Seris and Veyr, standing in the aftermath of their mutual sacrifice, embrace their loss and rediscover the true essence of their love. Their auras flare brilliantly in the wake of giving, impressing the city and the all-seeing Grand Lumen. Without their relics, they walk forward together, recognized and guided by the radiant bond their sacrifices have forged.",
