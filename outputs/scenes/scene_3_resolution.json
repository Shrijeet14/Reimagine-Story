  "text": "Iridescent moonlight spilled through the crystal panes, splattering the bare chamber with fractured constellations. Seris stood in their small spire-apartment, her hands trembling as she traced Loras\u2019s jaw, fingers hesitating over the edge where his aura, once vibrant indigo, now flickered a subdued violet-gray. The jeweled comb\u2014the Opaline Comb of Harmonizing she had received\u2014gleamed useless in her palm, its prismatic teeth whispering with resonance her veil of auralight could no longer answer. In his hands, the starlit chain\u2014her gift to him\u2014dangled limply, fine spirals of etched glass waiting for the Celestial Chron he had relinquished.\n\nLoras swallowed hard, voice rough as weathered stone. \u201cI\u2026 I thought if I lost the Chron, perhaps the moments I lost could be given to you instead.\u201d\n\nSeris shook her head, tears sparkling along the remnants of her auralight hair. Magic pulsed weak and uneven at her temples, the loss palpable as the ache in her chest. \u201cAnd I gave my veil\u2019s brilliance for you\u2014so your Chron would carry the light of every star we ever wished for.\u201d Her breath caught, the air thrumming with the hush of spent enchantment.\n\n\u201cFoolish,\u201d he murmured, yet his lips shaped a tremulous smile, drawn to hers by gravity deeper than any leyline. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing but empty hands\u2014no time to lend, nothing left but love.\u201d\n\nSeris slid the comb into her faded hair, feeling nothing but the comb\u2019s chill against her scalp. When she looked at Loras, it was not with despair, but a dawning awe. Their auras, though diminished, mingled at their edges\u2014a new, gentle spectrum where neither color dominated, impossibly soft but undeniably whole.\n\n\u201cWe are more than what we give away,\u201d Seris whispered, pressing her forehead to Loras\u2019s. Her words stitched into the hush, binding their wounds. \u201cThe magic was never in relics or light.\u201d\n\nAs the chamber filled with the wavering song of the distant city, their hearts answered in resonance\u2014each sacrifice weaving an unseen web that shimmered faintly, defying the loss. The moonlight, sensing the shift, cast their shadows as one: entwined, inseparable, and quietly radiant.\n\nOutside, the city\u2019s spires glimmered with silent witness, and within, Seris cupped Loras\u2019s face, hope fluttering in her fingers. \u201cWe begin again,\u201d she vowed, voice hushed yet fierce, as the first dawn shimmered across the glass.",
  "summary": "Seris and Loras, their magic and soul relics diminished by their mutual sacrifices, share the truth of their actions. Embracing in the fractured moonlight, they realize the depth of their love transcends relics or magical gifts. Their auras mingle in a fragile but beautiful new spectrum as they resolve to face the future together, transformed by selfless devotion.",
