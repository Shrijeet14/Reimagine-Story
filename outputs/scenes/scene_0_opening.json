  "text": "Dawn in Lumeris was a hush of prismatic mist, the city\u2019s crystal spires glimmering with threads of daylight that braided color through the highwalks. Seris pressed her palm to the frost-cool window, watching the mosaic of glasswork below\u2014vendors unspooling ribbons of mana between their fingers, glyph-lit gondolas gliding secrets overhead. Inside their snug tower room, arcane filaments were woven in the air by her own living relic: waves of aurora-bright hair cascading down her back, luminous tendrils catching the sunrise with jealous fire. \n\nHer hands shook as she counted mana shards on the lacquered sill. One. Another scraped from the bottom of a porcelain dish. And more\u2014only fragments\u2014clinking together in a measure of quiet despair. $1.87 in shard currency: too little to renew Veyr\u2019s fading mana chain, let alone honor the tradition of gifting at Solstice. \n\nSeris exhaled, her breath fogging the glass, and lifted the edge of her simple work-cloak. Her Aurora Tresses shifted, sentient filaments tightening in unease, responding to her aura\u2019s anxiety. With them, she once stitched moon-thread for the citadel\u2019s hierarchs, her status bright and envied. Now, she pictured slipping into the mana market\u2019s shaded corridors: Lys the broker\u2019s cold eyes, the buzz of extracting relics, the silent pain of losing part of herself. \n\nBut for Veyr\u2014tireless, gentle Veyr, his own aura always spent protecting the frail, tending AI nodes in the underways\u2014she would endure it. She recalled his pale face, exhausted but radiant, the battered lightwatch resting against his pulse. He needed her gift, a new chain\u2014a gesture to reassure him, to renew his link to purpose. \n\nThe city\u2019s clock-bells chimed: glass notes lacing through the stone. Seris swept her hair, gathering its living shimmer in both hands. As the first ripple of resolve settled through her, the filaments pulsed\u2014soft, blue-gold, hesitating. She pressed a trembling kiss to the glowing lengths, then cinched her cloak. Mist curled at the threshold as she left, her footsteps swallowed by refracted light, aurora flickering at her heels\u2014toward the place where sacrifices are measured, bought, and lost.",
  "summary": "In their narrow tower room overlooking the luminous city of Lumeris, Seris anxiously tallies her meager supply of mana shards. Realizing it is not enough to purchase a meaningful Solstice gift for her beloved partner Veyr, she steels herself to sacrifice her most precious possession\u2014her soulbound Aurora Tresses\u2014determined to give, even at great personal cost.",
