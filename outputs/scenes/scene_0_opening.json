  "text": "Night in the Crystal City hummed with hidden currents. The sky, never wholly dark, refracted in oceanic sheets across the impossibly tall, living towers\u2014surfaces rippling with spectral glyphs projected by the city\u2019s omnipresent intelligence. Down near the ground, along a narrow walkway preserved beneath a crystal arch, the air shimmered cold and dry, every footfall echoing off diamond-lattice walls. It smelled faintly medicinal: all synthetic ozone and the distant bite of recycled emotions flushing through public Synthex exchanges.\n\nSeren pressed herself deeper into her threadbare coat, pushing through a knot of festival-goers whose faces flickered with AI-rendered masks of delight. She ignored the pop-up alerts projected inside her vision by her bonded micro-AI\u2014\u2018Exprion balance low. Upgrade denied. Prescribed mood: conciliatory. STAY WITHIN EMOTIONAL BOUNDS.\u2019\u2014the notifications tingling like a cold warning in her bloodstream. She could sense the drain of Synthex all around her: joy and longing flash-traded, affection tuned or erased in a whisper over hidden networked conduits.\n\nShe kept her eyes fixed on the lower-lit booths where outland merchants and sanctioned auditors sat behind crystal panes, their wares glinting\u2014memory flasks, neural tokens, black-market AI fluid vials coaxed with forbidden colors. Her chest tightened as she caught her own reflection in a curved glass stall: pale in the greenish glow, hair braided up to conceal the implant at her nape. She reached up by reflex, brushing the back of her neck, feeling the micro-circuit\u2019s faint warmth, the ghost of her last legal AI fluid bond\u2014the one she\u2019d crafted for Dax, months ago, when hope still felt possible.\n\nAt the far end, the pale neon of Auditrix Kesh\u2019s booth beckoned, flickering icily: TRANSACTIONAL ZONE\u2014ALL FLUID EXCHANGES LICENSED. Kesh herself sat statue-still, augmented eyes glimmering with latticework code as she tabulated someone else\u2019s emotions into strict crystal vials. Seren wavered, pulse thundering, knowing she\u2019d saved every Exprion she could, but it would never be enough unless she broke the code\u2014unless she traded something precious, something core, for the only gift Dax would not let himself want.\n\nA flood of festival light cut sharply overhead\u2014fractal snow, simulated and dazzling. Seren took a trembling step forward, swallowed by the crowd\u2019s orchestrated cheer and the sterile promise of the auditor\u2019s smile, as inside, her own unedited affection threatened to spill past all sanctioned limits.",
  "summary": "Seren, an illegal AI fluid crafter living on the lower crystal tiers of the technologically strict Crystal City, weaves through bustling festival crowds, tormented by scarcity and under the constant surveillance of her micro-AI. Driven by love and anxiety over what she cannot provide her partner Dax, she approaches the cold, bureaucratic booth of Auditrix Kesh, determined to sacrifice a precious part of herself in hope of giving Dax a meaningful gift.",
