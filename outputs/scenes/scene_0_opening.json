  "text": "Moonlight bled through the latticed crystal of Lumeris, fretting along the cobblestones as Seris hurried beneath the kaleidoscopic spires. Her boots, patched and mana-scuffed, struck the pulse-lines etched into the city\u2019s thoroughfares\u2014a dull, echoing reminder of every mana shard she lacked. Around her, people glimmered with opalescent auras and wove spells with lazy, practiced grace; their laughter made the air feel too sharp, too brilliant. Seris tugged her long Veil of Auralight tighter around her shoulders, the cascading threads of enchanted, bioluminescent hair muffling the stray vibrations that sang at her auditory augmentations.\n\nIn her palm, the coin-pouch sagged\u2014so little weight for so much hope. She counted again: a meager clutch barely enough for stale bread or a single flicker-crystal for the lantern at home. But the Festival of Silver Moons loomed, and Loras deserved a gift worthy of his boundless devotion\u2014something to honor his Celestial Chron, the ancient timepiece he cherished and which anchored his magic. A prickle of shame wormed beneath her ribs. How could she face him empty-handed, her aura faded by want and worry?\n\nShe stepped from the main road into the shadow of the Quartz All\u00e9e; here, mana-lamps cast halos onto dream-dusted windows, illuminating relic merchants hawking starlit combs, glimmer-coins, wands with lullabies trapped within. Seris hesitated by the splayed door of a pawn cell\u2014its bell chimed with a sympathetic shimmer, resonating through her bones. Inside, rows of soul relics lay behind hex-glass: unanchored, yearning, just as desperate as she felt.\n\nA young Glass Guild courier paced past, his mantle brushed with motes of aura like drifting fireflies. Seris thought of Loras, always gentle, eyes limned with the faint glow of stored mana, voice low and resolute even when his shift dragged long into the moonlit night.\n\nThe longing pulsed sharp and sweet. Seris pressed trembling fingers to the ends of her Veil, feeling the living force coil there\u2014the very heart of her arcane gift. She swallowed, gaze drawn to a distant, impassive figure behind a pane of glyph-marked etherglass: Archivist Ysil, the Guild\u2019s most impassive broker, whose protocols promised payment\u2014if she could dare the cost.\n\nA pang of fear accompanied the resolve firming in her spine. She stepped inside, hair trailing like a comet\u2019s tail, the decision now humming through every fragment of her soul relic. Tonight, Loras would know how fiercely she loved him\u2014even if it meant her own magic grew forever dim.",
  "summary": "In the moonlit City of Crystal Spires, Seris\u2014an impoverished maintenance engineer\u2014navigates shimmering, arcane-drenched streets, desperately seeking a way to honor her beloved Loras at the Festival of Silver Moons. Haunted by scarcity yet refusing to surrender hope, Seris steels herself to make a painful sacrifice, stepping toward the relic broker who can purchase a fragment of her magical Veil of Auralight.",
