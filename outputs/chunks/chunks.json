    "The Gift of the Magi \u2014 O. Henry (Public Domain)\n\nJim and Della were a young married couple who lived in a small, humble apartment. Money was terribly tight\u2014so tight that on Christmas Eve, Della discovered she had only $1.87 saved to buy Jim a present. She longed to give him something worthy of her love, something fine and rare.\n\nDella\u2019s most prized possession was her long, beautiful hair, falling past her knees like a cascade of brown silk. Jim\u2019s treasure, equally precious to him, was a gold watch that had belonged to his father and grandfather.\n\nDesperate to buy Jim a gift, Della decided to sacrifice her hair. She rushed to a hair dealer, who bought her hair for twenty dollars. With the money, she searched high and low until she found the perfect present: a platinum chain for Jim\u2019s treasured watch.\n\nWhen Jim returned home that night, he stared at Della with a strange expression\u2014not of anger, but shock. Slowly, he revealed his own gift: a set of jeweled combs Della had admired for months. They were beautiful, but useless now that her hair was gone.\n\nDella, in turn, gave him the chain\u2014only to learn that Jim had sold his watch to buy the combs.\n\nThe couple embraced, overwhelmed by the purity of their love. They realized that their sacrifices, though ironically impractical, were the truest expression of their devotion. They were, as the story says, \u201cthe magi\u201d\u2014wise in the way that only love can be wise."
