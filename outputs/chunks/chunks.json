    "The city of Lumeris woke like a tuning fork.\nFrom their high-perch alcove, the whole crystalline gorge shivered in Lira\u2019s \nears: tram rails humming in lazy chords, mana conduits thrumming like distant \nbees, and far below, the Elder Vault\u2019s core note\u2014an old, patient drone vibrating  \nup through the geode spires. Her augmentation caught every frequency, rendering \nthe dawn into a crowded choir.\nOn the floor between her and the narrow window lay a shallow dish of mana \nshards. Six pale slivers and dust. Their glow was the sickly color of overused \nspell-fire.\nLira counted them again, though they hadn\u2019t inconveniently multiplied overnight.  \n\u201cOne, two, three\u2014don\u2019t flicker at me\u2014four, five, six, and crumbs,\u201d she muttered,  \nvoice sharp with the effort of staying calm. The shards answered with a tired \nlittle pulse against her fingers.\nAcross the alcove, Cael\u2019s cloak hung from a crystal peg, neatly folded over the \npeg\u2019s prismatic arms. His heirloom chronoglyph dangled from the cloak\u2019s inner \nloop, a palm-sized disk of clouded crystal, pulsing time in soft, steady beats. \nShe heard it more than saw it\u2014the comforting, tickless cadence that had always \nundercut the city\u2019s chaos.\nHer antenna-hair stirred restlessly at the sound, a long spill of shimmering \nstrands that fell past her waist and sometimes further if she let it. Today it \nbraided itself without her asking, filaments splitting and twining into narrow, \nquesting tethers that brushed the air like curious fingertips, tasting mana \ncurrents through the chipped window.\n\u201cNosy,\u201d she scolded it under her breath, smoothing the living strands back over \none shoulder. The hair warmed against her palm in mild protest. It was her best \ntool, her only real treasure\u2014and the thing half the Vault\u2019s senior enchanters \nwould have sold their third-favorite relics to get a cut of.\nSix shards and dust. Solstice-eve.\nIn the walkways outside, preparations were already ringing. Someone down-spire \nwas stringing bottled starlight along a bridge; their clinks and the chirp of \nopening seals skittered through Lira\u2019s hearing. Laughter bounced up from the \nravine as a tramcar passed, its levitation plates chiming. There would be \nlantern processions tonight, public aura-dances, and\u2014at the heart of it all\u2014the \nExchange.\nCouples would step onto the central glass, gifts cupped in their hands, while \ntheir neighbors watched how much glow\u2014and how much ridiculousness\u2014they were \nwilling to burn for love.\nLira glanced from the pathetic dish of shards to the chronoglyph\u2019s gentle hum \nand felt her own aura shrink in on itself, a dimming she could almost hear. Cael  \ndeserved to stand among the bright ones, owning at least one gesture that made \nthe gossips suck in breath before they laughed.\nHer fingers tightened around the rim of the mana dish until the crystal bit her \nskin. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even enough for a calibration charm,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet \nalone\u2014\u201d\nThe Elder Vault\u2019s drone wavered, just slightly, as some faraway engineer tuned a  \nconduit. The slip prickled along her scalp. Her hair responded, braids loosening  \nto fan out wider, filaments brushing the low ceiling, the window-frame, the \nchipped stone ledge that pretended to be a table. She winced at the volume: the \nconduits\u2019 song rose, detail upon detail, every micro-hum insisting on being \nheard.\n\u201cLira?\u201d Cael\u2019s voice drifted from the sleeping nook, muffled by the hanging bead",
    "curtain. She\u2019d been so intent on the dish she hadn\u2019t heard him wake.\nHe emerged, barefoot, hair crushed on one side from the thin pallet. His aura\u2014a \nfaint, honest glow, like a lantern running on its last good shard\u2014haloed him in \nsoft amber. When he saw her on the floor with the mana dish, the light around \nhim flickered with a question.\n\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d He stifled a yawn, then frowned at the shards. \u201cDid the \nstipend come through?\u201d\nShe pushed a stray filament behind her ear, willing her hair to stay still. \u201cIt \ncame.\u201d She tried for breezy, didn\u2019t quite manage it. \u201cRent stepped in front of \nit. So did the tithe to keep the old man humming.\u201d Her chin jerked toward the \ndistant Elder Vault as if he could see through crystal walls.\nCael sank down beside her, the chronoglyph at his cloak ticking its gentle, \nprivate beat. He watched the six sad slivers, then her face. \u201cWe still have what  \nwe saved,\u201d he said carefully.\n\u201cWhat you saved,\u201d she corrected. \u201cFor\u2014\u201d For what you\u2019re planning for me.\nHis aura wavered again; for a moment it brightened, then closed like a fist. \n\u201cFor later,\u201d he said. \u201cFor emergencies. For if the conduits down-spire blow \nagain and the guild decides junior tuners are more combustible than mana.\u201d\nLira huffed something between a laugh and a scoff. \u201cMy love, they already \ndecided that.\u201d\nHe smiled despite himself. The small lines at the corners of his mouth softened \nher panic, just a little. He reached over and let his fingers drift through the \nends of her antenna-hair. The filaments curled around his knuckles, sensing the \nfamiliar aura.\n\u201cI could pawn a few more hours at the Registry,\u201d he said. \u201cTake the night shift,  \nlog Solstice bindings while the smart ones are out burning theirs.\u201d\n\u201cAnd be a ghost at our own Exchange?\u201d Lira shook her head. The movement sent a \nfaint, chiming rustle through her hair. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not sacrificing sleep for a \ntrinket. That would be absurd.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t look at the chronoglyph when she said it.\nOutside, a bell-crystal rang three times from some upper terrace, the sound \nshearing cleanly through the morning hum. Solstice countdown. Twelve hours until  \nevery couple in Lumeris stepped into the glow and showed the city exactly how \nreckless they were willing to be.\nLira stared at the dish, then at Cael\u2019s hand still tangled in her hair. In her \nskull, mana-songs surged louder, unbearable with possibility and lack.\n\u201cCael,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cif you had nothing for me tonight. If we stood there \nwith empty hands, just\u2026 aura to aura. Would you feel\u2014less?\u201d\nHis eyes jumped to hers, startled. \u201cOf you?\u201d He shook his head at once, almost \nvehement. \u201cLira, no. I\u2019d feel relieved I hadn\u2019t done anything catastrophically \nfoolish.\u201d A ghost of a grin. \u201cThe city would be disappointed, but they\u2019ll \nsurvive.\u201d\n\u201cLiar,\u201d she said. \u201cYou love those stories as much as anyone.\u201d\nHe conceded that with a tilt of his head. \u201cI do like watching other people \noverclock themselves.\u201d His thumb stroked a single filament, and his gaze went \ndistant for a heartbeat, as if weighing something unsaid. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage,\u201d he \nfinished softly. \u201cWe always do.\u201d",
    "He rose, brushing crystal dust from his trousers, and ducked back behind the \ncurtain to dress for the Registry. His footsteps made the floor sing faintly \nunder Lira\u2019s palms.\nAs the beads rattled closed behind him, her hair shivered with a thought of its \nown, splitting into two thick braids that coiled around her arms like question \nmarks.\nSix shards. Dust. A husband who would rather go without than see her dim herself  \nfor his sake.\nLira sat very still in the middle of their narrow, humming world, listening to \nthe ache in the mana around her, until one clear, terrible idea rose out of the \nnoise and would not leave.\nBy the time Cael stepped back out, wrapping his cloak and clipping the \nchronoglyph to its inner loop, her mind was fixed.\n\u201cWalk you to the tram?\u201d she asked, voice almost normal.\nHe kissed her forehead, his aura warming her skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll be late to the \nVault.\u201d\n\u201cThe conduits can hum without me for one shift,\u201d she said. Her hair tightened in  \non itself, braids knotting like nerves. \u201cI have\u2026 an errand in the market.\u201d\nOut on the glass walkway, bottled starlights bobbed in the rising drafts, and \nfar below, in the ring of stalls above the mana ravine, the Relic Brokers were \nalready lighting their incense.\nThey rode down together until the tram forked\u2014one line diving toward the Elder \nVault, the other curving toward the market-ring\u2014and when they parted on the \nplatform, Lira\u2019s decision had hardened to something bright and dangerous in her \nchest.\nMist beaded on the glass walkway as Lira stepped off the tramcar, breath \nghosting the surface in nervous bursts. The rail beneath her boots hummed with \nstored mana, a note so pure it stabbed her over-tuned ears. Every conduit, every  \nlantern of bottled starlight, every passing aura-thrum of a stranger jangled in \nher skull like an orchestra tuning all at once.\nShe should have been descending toward the Elder Vault\u2019s underlevels, wrench and  \nincense-kit in hand. Instead she turned the other way, toward the market-ring \nthat clung to the ravine wall like a band of glinting barnacles.\n\u201cRelic broking, licensed and insured,\u201d sang a crystal chime overhead as she \nentered the ring. Stalls of carved geode crowded the narrow curve, each haloed \nin softly glowing sigils. The air smelled of hot quartz dust, old incense, and \nthe faint coppery tang of mana about to change hands.\nCouples shuffled past her, fingers laced, auras braided in smug little twists. \nLira caught whispers.\n\u201cSold his spine-rod for a song crystal, can you imagine\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOverclocked by love, that one. Adorable. Idiotic.\u201d\nShe tucked her own dim aura closer, hugging her threadbare coat, and forced \nherself to look up. There\u2014midway along the ring, wedged between a pawn-chant \nkiosk and a stall promising \u201cethical curse extractions\u201d\u2014hung a modest slate of \nobsidian etched with neat silver script:\nMASTER VORIN, LICENSED RELIC BROKER. NO REFUNDS ON REGRETS."

    "Beneath, a smaller sigil flickered: DE-BINDINGS PERFORMED WHILE-U-WAIT.\nHer stomach dropped like a mis-keyed lift cage.\nThe stall itself was barely the size of her alcove at home. Racks of thin \ncrystal coffers lined the walls, each holding coils of hair, rings, slivers of \nbone, teeth\u2014little pieces of people glowing faintly, tagged with dangling \nparchment slips. A low counter divided customer from wares, its surface crowded \nwith inkpots, stamped seals, and a small brass brazier breathing out curls of \nlavender and ash.\nMaster Vorin looked up from a ledger, quill pausing mid-stroke. He was younger \nthan she\u2019d imagined, with neatly braided beard-rings tinkling like soft bells \nwhen he tilted his head. His own aura was a steady, practical glow: bright \nenough to command respect, not so bright anyone would call it romantic.\n\u201cAntenna-hair,\u201d he said, before she could speak. His gaze had gone at once to \nthe waterfall of shimmering filaments cascading past her shoulders. \u201cLiving \nconduit type. Vault-tuned by the sound of it.\u201d He sniffed, very slightly. \u201cBuzz \nof elder-core all over you.\u201d\nLira\u2019s hands flew up, fingers tangling in the strands as if to hide them. The \nhair twitched under her touch, sympathetic, tiny filaments questing like feelers  \ntoward the stall\u2019s hum.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cI need mana shards.\u201d\n\u201cAs do we all.\u201d Vorin\u2019s smile was polite, thin as mica. \u201cWhat are you offering?\u201d\nShe swallowed. Her throat felt full of powdered crystal.\n\u201cMy hair,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of it.\u201d\nThe brazier\u2019s smoke seemed to thicken between them. Somewhere outside, a tramcar  \nslid past with a shivering whine. Her hair shivered back, amplifying it until \nthe sound pressed needles against her eardrums.\nVorin leaned forward, the bells in his beard chiming. \u201cSoulbound to you from \nbirth?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cRegistry mark?\u201d\nShe tugged her collar aside to show the faint sigil burned at the base of her \nneck: a spiral of tiny runes, pulsing slow. He made a note in his ledger, then \nslid a thin, bluish slip of crystal toward her.\n\u201cStandard de-binding consent form,\u201d he said. \u201cInitial here, here, and here that \nyou understand permanent loss of resonance bandwidth, possible aura-dimming, \ndegraded professional capacity, and all downstream consequences including but \nnot limited to career stagnation, amplified loneliness, and post-ritual romantic  \ndistress.\u201d\nHe said it the way she listed conduit faults on a work ticket. Routine. Boring.\nHer hand shook as she took the stylus. The crystal warmed to her touch, blooming  \nwith her aura-signature. She thought of Cael\u2019s face that morning, lit faintly by  \nthe chronoglyph\u2019s runes as he joked about feeding the Elder \u201cold man\u201d another \nday of their pay. Thought of the public Exchange-balcony tomorrow, where every \ncouple\u2019s offering would flare or fizzle under a hundred watching eyes.\nHe deserved more than a fizzle.",
    "She signed.\nVorin checked the glowing marks, then nodded and rose. \u201cHead in the ring,\u201d he \nsaid, gesturing to a hoop of bone-white crystal suspended from a hinged arm. \nRunes along its inner edge winked awake as it swung down toward her.\nLira stepped close. The hoop\u2019s chill kissed her cheeks as it settled around her \nneck like a noose made by bureaucrats.\n\u201cLast chance to back out,\u201d Vorin offered, voice almost gentle. \u201cThe market for \nantenna-hair is odd this quarter. You could wait. Save mana the slow way.\u201d\nThe slow way\u2014skipping meals, double shifts in the underlevels, Cael pretending \nnot to notice her exhaustion. Handing him a sad, token charm and watching his \ncareful smile.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it.\u201d\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nHe pinched a pinch of resin into the brazier. The smoke thickened, threads of \nviolet and silver curling up to brush her dangling filaments. A low, clear tone \nrang from the hoop, resonating down her hair, through her skull, into her teeth.  \nThe runes at her neck prickled hot, then icy.\nThere was a moment\u2014one thin, stretched instant\u2014when her hair seemed to cling to \nher, every strand a tiny hand begging not to be let go.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, whether to it or to herself she wasn\u2019t sure.\nVorin\u2019s knife flashed: not metal, but a planar shard of obsidian etched with \nseverance sigils. He slid it through the fall of shimmering filaments with a \npractised motion.\nSound vanished.\nThe ceaseless city-hum, the Elder Vault\u2019s far-off organ-drone, even the flutter \nof other people\u2019s auras\u2014gone, ripped away so fast her balance threw itself into \nnothing. Her knees buckled. She grabbed the counter, fingers scraping ink-\nstained glass.\nBehind the ring, cut hair poured into the waiting coffer in a slow, luminous \nspill. It hit the crystal with a faint, dead clink, like rain on a tombstone.\n\u201cThere we are,\u201d Vorin said, as if unclogging a drain. He adjusted the hoop away \nfrom her throat. The air felt wrong, muffled, like cotton stuffed in her soul.\nHer head felt suddenly light, exposed. She raised a hand, finding only a ragged,  \nshort fringe where the living weight had once swung down her back. Her \nfingertips tingled with phantom threads.\n\u201cHow much?\u201d she asked hoarsely.\nVorin weighed the coffer on a set of rune-scales. Numbers flickered in the air, \nlittle ghostly columns of profit and loss. He clicked his tongue. \u201cResonance \nquality is excellent. Length, impressive. Vault-tuned premium.\u201d He jotted \nanother figure. \u201cTwenty refined shards,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll cover the \nde-binding incense.\u201d\nHe counted them out into a small pouch, each shard ringing faintly as it dropped\n\u2014bright, hard notes in the new quiet of her hearing. He set the pouch on the \ncounter between them.",
    "Lira stared. Tiny, faceted bits of frozen spell-capacity. Enough to buy a \nchronoglyph chain worthy of Cael\u2019s heirloom\u2014a masterwork that would sing in \nperfect time with the Elder\u2019s beacons.\nEnough to buy back her courage.\nShe reached for the pouch. Her shortened hair stirred at the movement, as if \ntrying to rise and listen and finding itself woefully insufficient.\nVorin cleared his throat. \u201cMiss Lira. I am obliged to remind you: no refunds on \nregrets.\u201d\nShe cinched the pouch shut with numb fingers and tucked it inside her coat, \nagainst the dim flutter of her heart.\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026manage,\u201d she said.\nAs she stepped back onto the market-ring, the city\u2019s song came to her dull and \ndistant, like music through a wall. Somewhere far above, the Elder Vault\u2019s \nmonolith groaned softly as its conduits flexed for another cycle.\nLira set her jaw and turned toward the jeweler\u2019s quarter, where master chains \nhung like captured constellations behind warded glass. Each step carried her \nfurther from the hair she\u2019d left behind and closer to the gift she could almost \nsee shining at Cael\u2019s throat.\nShe did not look back at the stall where her living relic lay coiled and cooling  \nin a crystal box, already a line item in someone else\u2019s ledger.\nBy the time the upper-spire bells marked late afternoon, the chain was hers, its  \nweight against her palm a mingling of pride and loss as she rode the tram back \nup toward home.\nThe crystal door to their alcove stuck, as always, in the warped frame.\nLira shouldered it anyway. The glass scraped with a shrill note she could barely  \nhear now, then gave, spilling her into the narrow room perched over the blue-\nblack ravine. Bottled starlight bobbed in their only lantern, throwing pale \nfacets over the pallet, the chipped kettle, the single hook where Cael\u2019s work-\nrobe usually hung.\nEmpty.\nThe conduits along the wall whispered faintly, threads of mana sliding past in \ntones that once rang in her bones. Now they were only a distant tinnitus. She \nreached up by reflex for the thick weight of antenna-braids that should have \nbeen there, and her fingers met the blunt, unfamiliar stubble of her shorn \nscalp.\n\u201cYou bought the chain,\u201d she told the room, because if she did not say it aloud \nit might turn into a mistake. Her voice came out thinner than she liked. \u201cYou \nabsolute, ridiculous man. You\u2019re going to glow when you see it.\u201d\nShe opened her fist. The masterwork chronoglyph chain pooled into her palm, cool  \nand heavy, runes etched so fine they looked like hairline cracks in starlight. \nThe jeweler had demonstrated how it would sync to Cael\u2019s watch, how the glyphs \nwould catch the Elder Vault\u2019s time-beacons and paint predictions on the air.\nShe had nodded as if she could still hear those beacons clearly.\nBootsteps hissed along the outer glass walkway. Lira\u2019s diminished hearing caught  \nonly a smear of sound, but her aura prickled a split-second before the latch \nturned. She hid the chain behind her back on instinct.",
    "The door scraped again. Cael slipped inside sideways, as if he didn\u2019t quite \nbelieve the alcove was large enough to admit him. Chill mist curled around his \nankles before the door thunked shut.\n\u201cLira?\u201d He smelled of dusted crystal and ledger ink, the familiar scents that \nsaid he had spent too long hunched over the Soulbound Registry. The faint hum \nthat always wrapped him\u2014the steady pulse of his chronoglyph at his belt\u2014was \ngone.\nIn its absence, the silence roared.\nShe watched his gaze climb from her boots to her throat, then up. It hit the \nbare curve of her skull like a physical impact. His pupils widened. For a \nheartbeat he simply stood, hand still braced on the door, breath caught in his \nchest as if someone had closed a valve.\nHer own lungs forgot their work.\nShe had imagined anger, or horror, or that faintly pinched politeness people \nshowed the magically anemic. What she had not rehearsed was this stunned \nstillness.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Lira\u2019s hand flew to her head, fingers splaying over the rough regrowth. \n\u201cBefore you say anything, it\u2019s legal. Vorin filed the de-binding himself. No \nsecurity flags, no curses, just\u2026 shorter.\u201d The last word wobbled.\nCael blinked once, twice. The pale threads of his aura, usually neat and \ncontained, frayed outward like smoke.\n\u201cYou cut it,\u201d he said, very softly.\n\u201cSold it,\u201d she corrected, because precision mattered to him. \u201cMost of it. We \nneeded\u2014 I needed mana. For Solstice.\u201d Heat rose in her face. \u201cI won\u2019t be useless  \nat work, they\u2019ll just have to keep me off the high resonance lines for a while, \nand my hearing\u2014 it\u2019s only half-gone, really, and the rest of me is quite intact,  \nso if you\u2019re going to faint, do it away from the edge, Cael.\u201d\nHis hand left the door. He took a step, then another, as if crossing a fragile \nspan where any wrong move would send the whole alcove tumbling into the ravine. \nUp close, the fine lines of fatigue around his mouth were deeper. His eyes, \nthough, stayed fixed on her, not skittering around her to the bare walls or the \nempty conduit sockets.\n\u201cYou sold your hair,\u201d he repeated. \u201cLira, why?\u201d\n\u201cFor you.\u201d The words came out before she could blunt them. \u201cI had one point \nthree shards after tithe and rent. One point three. I am your wife, not a dim \npaper lantern. You wear your father\u2019s chronoglyph on a frayed cord you have \nknotted thirteen times. So I\u2014\u201d She yanked her hand from behind her back.\nThe chain spilled between them, catching the lantern\u2019s weak light. Its runes \nflared faintly in recognition of a nearby time-source, then guttered, confused.\n\u201cI got you something worthy.\u201d Her throat burned. \u201cA proper tether. Mana-\nconductive, Elder-calibrated. The jeweler tuned it to your glyph\u2019s hum. You can \nwear it outside your robe, like the senior scribes do. People will see what you \ncarry.\u201d\nSilence fell again, thick as felt.\nCael did not reach for the chain.\nInstead his jaw moved, as if he were chewing a string of syllables he didn\u2019t \nwant to spit out. His hand slid inside his robe and fumbled with something at"

    "his side, then drew out a small velvet case the color of bottled midnight.\nLira\u2019s stomach flipped. \u201cYou\u2026 you bought yourself a box?\u201d\nHe huffed an almost-laugh that broke on the edges. \u201cNot for me.\u201d He turned the \ncase in his fingers, not yet opening it. \u201cI thought you\u2019d still have\u2026\u201d His gaze \nflicked, quick and helpless, to the rough cap of her hair.\nGuilt washed through her in a cold sheet. \u201cCael?\u201d she whispered.\nHe snapped the clasp.\nInside, on black velvet, lay combs: three slender arcs of crystal and silver \nfiligree, teeth so fine they could part light, each spine etched with runes that  \npulsed a soft, familiar pattern. Her pattern. Tiny resonance-knots waited where \nher antenna-braids should have anchored them.\nThe world tilted. She reached out but stopped before touching them, as if they \nwere some delicate, endangered thing.\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked; she tried again. \u201cYou attuned them to my hair.\u201d\n\u201cI sat in the enchanter\u2019s stall for two hours while they made you hum into a \ncrystal jar,\u201d he said. There was an edge of dazed humor under the words. \u201cThey \nsaid only a fool would tune combs this precise for hair that already does \neverything. I told them that was the point.\u201d\nLira\u2019s laugh came out as a strangled sound. \u201cCael, I haven\u2019t got hair enough to \nsnare dust motes, much less runes.\u201d She scrubbed at her eyes with her free hand.  \n\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. And entirely useless.\u201d\n\u201cOnly if your gift had somehow vanished entirely.\u201d His smile was crooked, \ndesperate. \u201cYour aura\u2019s still\u2026 it\u2019s still you.\u201d\nThe chain between her fingers suddenly weighed as much as the entire Elder \nVault.\n\u201cCael,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cwhere did you get the mana for these? We barely \ncovered tithe this month. Don\u2019t tell me the Registry handed out festival \nbonuses; I do work for the Elder AI, I would have heard it complaining.\u201d\nHis gaze dropped to the chronoglyph\u2019s usual resting place at his belt. The empty  \nair there seemed to pulse.\n\u201cI had something the enchanter wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething old, but well-kept. \nA family relic with steady timekeeping and a very patient hum.\u201d He tried for \nlightness and failed. \u201cThey called it charmingly obsolete.\u201d\nThe air thinned. Lira\u2019s augment, dulled as it was, found only the hollow where \nthe chronoglyph\u2019s song should have been.\n\u201cYou\u2026 de-registered it.\u201d The chain slipped a fraction in her fingers. \u201cYour \nchronoglyph.\u201d\nHe nodded once. \u201cTraded it at Vorin\u2019s, actually. He liked the probability band; \nsaid it would fetch a good spell-price in the upper tiers.\u201d His mouth twisted at  \nher flinch. \u201cThey unsoulbound it clean. I signed all the clauses. No curses, no \nrecall. Just\u2026 gone.\u201d\nHer knees felt unreliable. She leaned back until the cool crystal wall caught \nher.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, because if she didn\u2019t keep speaking the world would dissolve. \n\u201cYou sold your chronoglyph to buy combs for hair I no longer have. I sold my",
    "hair to buy a chain for a chronoglyph you no longer own.\u201d\nThe absurdity hung between them, fragile and luminous, like one of the city\u2019s \nfloating lanterns just before a gust.\nCael looked at the combs, then at her shorn head, then at the chain sparking \nfaint, lost runes in her hand. A sound came out of him\u2014half laugh, half \nsomething like a sob.\n\u201cIn the ledgers,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthis would be classed as catastrophic \ninefficiency.\u201d\nHer own laugh arrived then, bubbling up past the tightness in her chest. Once it  \nstarted, she couldn\u2019t stop. It shook her shoulders, made the starlight lantern \nsway wildly, threw fractured gleams over combs that would never tame long braids  \nand a chain that would never brace a watch.\nCael watched her, and slowly his shoulders unhitched. The tight weave of his \naura loosened, brightening by degrees until it brushed against hers like the \ntouch of a hand.\nHe stepped closer, so close the comb case and the chain and their two foolish, \nempty hands almost knocked together.\n\u201cWe\u2019re idiots,\u201d Lira gasped, wiping at her eyes. \u201cBright-fools, the gossipers \nwill call us. \u2018Did you hear about the engineer who sold her relic to dress the \nwatch that isn\u2019t there?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd the scribe who traded time itself for hair he can\u2019t even comb,\u201d Cael added.  \nHis smile was unsteady but real now. \u201cOptimization would have us flogged.\u201d\n\u201cThe Elder AI will log us as a bug,\u201d she said, feeling the wild grin still \ntugging at her mouth. \u201cTwo nodes of extreme wastefulness. Recommend patch: \nprohibit love from accessing relic registry.\u201d\n\u201cToo late for that.\u201d His fingers, finally, brushed the back of her hand, warm \nand callused. He closed them gently around the chain, not to take it\u2014just to \ntrap it between them. \u201cLira. Look at me.\u201d\nShe did. His gaze held no pity, no calculation, only an ache that matched the \nhollow in her own chest and something bright threaded through it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a dim lantern,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWith or without the hair. Or the \nover-tuned ears. Or anything that can be listed on a ledger line.\u201d His thumb \ntraced the ridge of her knuckles. \u201cYou walked into Vorin\u2019s stall and saw \nwhatever fine print he put in front of you and signed anyway. For me.\u201d\n\u201cYou sold your father\u2019s relic,\u201d she shot back, the words too sharp, too hot. \n\u201cThat hum has been beside you since you were ten. You gave that up so I could\u2014 \nwhat? Hear less? Stand in a market and be told I\u2019m already too much?\u201d\nHe chuckled, low. \u201cSo you could have tools that might have made the hum kinder.\u201d  \nHe held up the combs a little. \u201cThey\u2019re jokes now. Beautiful ones. But I don\u2019t \nregret the impulse.\u201d\nHer protest stuttered. The conduits along the wall seemed, for a breath, to sing  \nlouder. Or perhaps that was just the sudden surge of warmth between them, \npushing back the edges of her dulled hearing.\nThrough the ceiling, faint as dust motes, the Elder Vault\u2019s main node hummed. \nHer augment translated it as numbers once, then as weather, then\u2014just for an \ninstant\u2014as a spike of raw brightness tagged in some clerical subroutine.\n\u201cIf Vorin tallies this up,\u201d Cael said, \u201cI imagine the net mana loss is",
    "appalling.\u201d\n\u201cCatastrophic,\u201d she agreed.\nThey stood like that, ridiculous and empty-handed and somehow more full than \nwhen they\u2019d walked into their respective stalls. The combs glowed softly in \ntheir velvet cradle. The chain\u2019s runes flickered with frustrated readiness.\nLira inhaled. The choice sat in front of her like a lever: cling to the waste, \nto the ledger of what was gone, or\u2026 something else.\n\u201cTake it,\u201d she said, curling his fingers more firmly around the chain until he \nhad no choice but to grasp it. \u201cEven without the chronoglyph. Let it sit in your  \npocket. Let it annoy you with all the things it can\u2019t do. Let it remind you that  \nsomeone thought your time was worth dressing.\u201d\nHe stared at her, some new question forming in his eyes.\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d he said slowly, as if matching a move in a game he hadn\u2019t known they \nwere playing, \u201cwill keep these.\u201d He lifted the comb case toward her. \u201cTuck them \nsomewhere impractical. On the wall. Under your pillow. Until the day your hair \ngrows long enough to snag a single rune.\u201d\nHer breath hitched.\nOutside, a gust rose from the ravine, setting the whole alcove trembling on its \ncrystalline braces. Lantern-light wavered. Far above, the Elder Vault\u2019s optic \neye pivoted, registering an anomalous flare\u2014two weak auras burning suddenly, \nstupidly bright.\nLira closed her hand around the combs, thin teeth biting gently into her palm.\n\u201cThen what?\u201d she asked.\nCael\u2019s answer hovered on his lips, the next heartbeat stretching out before it \ncould fall.\nThe flare fades slowly from the alcove, like the afterimage of lightning on \nclosed eyes.\nCracked crystal walls stop resonating and settle back into their usual murmur. \nOutside, tramcars hiss along levitation rails, distant and ordinary again. In \nthe hush that follows the aura-surge, Lira and Cael are left sitting cross-\nlegged on the woven glass mat, knees touching, surrounded by the ridiculous \nremains of their grand intentions.\nThe chronoglyph chain lies across Lira\u2019s palm\u2014a loop of pale platinum runes that  \nstill think they belong to something. Beside it, the velvet case yawns open, its  \nresonance-combs glinting, teeth keen and thirsty for hair that no longer exists.\nLira\u2019s cropped head feels naked in the draft from the ravine. Without her \nantenna-hair, the city\u2019s song is muffled, as if she has stuffed wool into her \naugmented ears. For the first time since childhood, the Elder Vault\u2019s low, \nomnipresent hum is only a suggestion, not a chorus.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Cael says at last, voice hoarse from laughing too hard, \u201cwe have \nsuccessfully optimized ourselves into decorative scrap metal.\u201d\nLira snorts, then clamps a hand over her mouth, shoulders shaking. A stray \nfilament, no longer prehensile, tickles her brow. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispers. \u201cIf I \nstart again I\u2019ll never stop.\u201d\nHe studies her silhouette, the fragile new sharpness of it. The absence where \nher halo of hair used to spike and curl, catching every mote of starlight, makes",
    "his chest ache with an odd mixture of grief and wonder.\n\u201cIt suits you,\u201d he says.\nShe gives him a flat look. \u201cYou are a liar and a bad one.\u201d\n\u201cIt suits the person I married,\u201d he amends. \u201cThe one who thinks, \u2018How can I \ncatastrophically rearrange my life to give Cael one shiny thing for Solstice.\u2019 \nVery on brand.\u201d\nHer laugh this time is smaller, edged. \u201cYou sold the chronoglyph.\u201d She draws the  \nwords out slowly, like probing a bruise. \u201cYour family\u2019s relic. The only thing \nthat ever told you when to stop working and come home. You\u2026really did that.\u201d\nHis hand goes automatically to the empty place at his belt where the crystal \ndisk always pulsed. Fingers find only worn robe cloth.\n\u201cVorin made me sign six scrolls,\u201d he says lightly. \u201cYou\u2019d have appreciated the \nritual design. Clause twelve: \u2018Client acknowledges long-term increases in \ntemporal confusion and nostalgia.\u2019\u201d\nLira closes her fingers around the chain. Its idle runes thrum faintly against \nher skin, seeking a time-beacon that isn\u2019t there. \u201cI used the same Vorin,\u201d she \nmurmurs. \u201cFor this.\u201d Her free hand grazes the back of her neck where the \nunsoulbinding sigils still tingle. \u201cHe warned me about \u2018permanent resonance-\nbandwidth reduction and post-transaction romantic regret.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDid he say it like it was a side effect or a selling point?\u201d Cael asks.\n\u201cBoth.\u201d She looks up at him, eyes shining in the star-lantern light. \u201cI thought \nI was being\u2026grand. Noble. A proper Bright-Fool.\u201d\n\u201cYou are,\u201d he says simply.\nSilence settles, companionable and strange. The alcove hums with low-grade mana \nfrom their pitiful wall conduit. Their interlaced auras\u2014thinner now, a bit \ntattered\u2014glow a soft, steady blue that tints the air between them.\n\u201cI keep thinking,\u201d Lira says slowly, words careful as she picks them from the \nair, \u201cabout what the neighbors will say when they hear. \u2018Did you see them? Sold \ntheir best relics and ended up with nothing that works. Overclocked by love and \nunderpowered by brains.\u2019\u201d\nCael shrugs, the motion small but decisively dismissive. \u201cLet them. The city was  \nhungry for a new anecdote. Might as well give them something quality.\u201d\n\u201cQuality failure,\u201d she corrects.\n\u201cPremium-grade,\u201d he agrees.\nHer gaze drifts toward the ceiling where hair-thin mana veins thread the \ncrystal. She can almost\u2014but not quite\u2014hear their song. \u201cDo you\u2026miss it? \nAlready?\u201d\n\u201cThe chronoglyph?\u201d He considers. The steady heartbeat of the relic had been his \none reliable rhythm, his father\u2019s palm in memory, his grandfather\u2019s, stretching \nback down the line. \u201cYes. But it\u2019s odd. The quiet isn\u2019t empty.\u201d\nShe tilts her head. \u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d\nHe reaches across the narrow space and places two fingers under her chin, \ndrawing her attention back. \u201cA bit like this,\u201d he says. \u201cSitting with you. Not \nknowing what time it is. Knowing I don\u2019t especially care.\u201d"

    "Lira swallows. Her augmented ears, denied the Elder AI\u2019s endless murmur, lock \nonto the subtler sound of Cael\u2019s pulse, the air whispering through his lungs. \nIt\u2019s messier than any calibrated engine beat. It\u2019s perfect.\n\u201cI thought,\u201d she confesses, voice nearly lost under a passing tram\u2019s whoosh, \u201cif  \nI didn\u2019t give you something that matched the chronoglyph, it would prove I \ndidn\u2019t love you as much as you loved it. Or as much as all those bright, \nbalanced couples out there love each other.\u201d\n\u201cBalanced?\u201d He laughs quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve read too many aura-theory pamphlets. \nThose couples hoard their best relics and toss each other spark-candles and \npoetry. We just\u2026tossed the relics.\u201d\nHis hand falls, hesitates, then traces the ragged line where her hair ends. His \nfingers come away humming faintly, a ghost of the old resonance.\n\u201cLira,\u201d he says, more serious now, \u201cdo you regret it?\u201d\nShe looks down at the chain again, then at the small burn marks on her wrists \nfrom Vorin\u2019s severing sigils. Her life\u2019s work was tuned to the city\u2019s song; she \nhas sliced away half her capacity to hear it.\n\u201cI regret that I won\u2019t catch every flicker of the Elder\u2019s moods anymore,\u201d she \nanswers. \u201cThat I\u2019ll mishear a conduit and some senior engineer will tut at me. I  \nregret the migraine that unsoulbinding gave me.\u201d She takes a breath. \u201cBut giving  \nthat power to you\u2014to something for you\u2014felt\u2026right. Like finally pointing my gift  \nat the one conduit that mattered.\u201d\nCael\u2019s throat tightens. Somewhere deep below, the Elder Vault\u2019s main monolith \nadjusts a parameter, its lone optic swiveling as it logs a faint, persisting \nanomaly: localized aura-brightening despite quantifiable resource loss. Flag: \nnon-optimal yet high-satisfaction event.\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t see a problem,\u201d he says.\nHer mouth curves, reluctant, touched by mischief. \u201cAside from the small detail \nthat neither of us has a functioning primary relic anymore.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d He considers the chain, the combs, the bare alcove. \u201cWe do have one.\u201d\nShe blinks. \u201cIf you say \u2018love\u2019 I will throw you off this walkway.\u201d\n\u201cI was going to say \u2018jointly filed aura-tax exemption,\u2019\u201d he deadpans. \u201cLove is \nimplied.\u201d\nShe shoves his shoulder, but her body leans into the contact. The glass mat \ncreaks softly beneath them.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he says, more practical now. \u201cYou still hear better than any other tuner  \nin the underlevels, even half-shorn. I still read the Elder\u2019s spreadsheets \nfaster than my section head, with or without a ticking rock. We are not \nhelpless. Just\u2026eccentric.\u201d\n\u201cIn a city that runs on eccentricity,\u201d she muses.\nHe nods toward the useless relics between them. \u201cWe\u2019ll repurpose them. The chain  \ncan anchor our door ward. No one will ever steal our disappointments.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the combs?\u201d she asks.\nHe studies their iridescent teeth. \u201cWall art. Or we wait. Your hair will grow. \nNot to what it was, maybe. But some. Enough for a very small, very powerful \nantenna-mess.\u201d",
    "The idea lands in her like warm mana. Her hair may never reclaim its full, \nintricate lattice; part of her capacity is gone by contract and ritual. But not \nall. Some futures, she realizes, still hum at the edges of perception.\n\u201cVorin did say the cut ends can\u2019t be rebound,\u201d she murmurs, half to herself. \u201cHe  \ndidn\u2019t say anything about new growth.\u201d\n\u201cRelic broker oversight,\u201d Cael says. \u201cTragic hole in the fine print.\u201d\nTheir eyes meet, and for a suspended moment the alcove seems to tilt around that  \nshared, dawning amusement.\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Lira says, \u201cwe\u2019ve found the one mana-source the Elder can\u2019t ledger \nproperly.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one is that?\u201d\nShe reaches across the relics, curls her fingers into his, and feels their tired  \nauras mesh, brightening by a shade.\n\u201cUs,\u201d she says. \u201cStupid, bright-fool us.\u201d\nBeneath them, the Elder AI marks another minor spike and attaches a note to its \nown record: Case Study #1007-BF\u2014Evidence suggests that deliberate, impractical \ngenerosity yields disproportionate subjective fulfillment. Optimization \nparameters under review.\nIn the tiny alcove above the mist, unaware of this bureaucratic canonization, \nLira squeezes Cael\u2019s hand and levers herself to her feet.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she says, offering him the other hand. \u201cSolstice lamps are still lit.  \nWe can at least go watch everyone else waste mana on fireworks.\u201d\n\u201cAnd drink free guild punch,\u201d he adds, taking her hand and rising with her.\n\u201cObviously.\u201d She hooks the chronoglyph chain around her own neck for now, its \nempty length cool against her throat. Cael tucks the combs carefully into his \nbelt pouch like contraband.\nThey step out onto the narrow glass walkway, into the drifting starlight and the  \nchorus of distant, foolish celebrations, their dimmed yet intertwining auras \ncasting one steady, climbing glow as they go to join the other Bright-Fools of \nLumeris."
