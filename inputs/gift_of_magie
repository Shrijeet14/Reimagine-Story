The Gift of the Magi — O. Henry (Public Domain)

Jim and Della were a young married couple who lived in a small, humble apartment. Money was terribly tight—so tight that on Christmas Eve, Della discovered she had only $1.87 saved to buy Jim a present. She longed to give him something worthy of her love, something fine and rare.

Della’s most prized possession was her long, beautiful hair, falling past her knees like a cascade of brown silk. Jim’s treasure, equally precious to him, was a gold watch that had belonged to his father and grandfather.

Desperate to buy Jim a gift, Della decided to sacrifice her hair. She rushed to a hair dealer, who bought her hair for twenty dollars. With the money, she searched high and low until she found the perfect present: a platinum chain for Jim’s treasured watch.

When Jim returned home that night, he stared at Della with a strange expression—not of anger, but shock. Slowly, he revealed his own gift: a set of jeweled combs Della had admired for months. They were beautiful, but useless now that her hair was gone.

Della, in turn, gave him the chain—only to learn that Jim had sold his watch to buy the combs.

The couple embraced, overwhelmed by the purity of their love. They realized that their sacrifices, though ironically impractical, were the truest expression of their devotion. They were, as the story says, “the magi”—wise in the way that only love can be wise.
